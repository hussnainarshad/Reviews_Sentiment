Dang. I bought another 4 pairs of these. Comfort heaven straight out of the box. The only issue is that the shoe strings cannot stay tied for anything - even in double knots...it's very odd - and this is the case on all the pairs. Other than that, wow.

I hope Nike never stops making these shoes. There are a couple of minor negatives. The soles are prone to pick up pebbles and the sole wears quickly. Even so, the 5-star rating is well deserved. The shoes are the barefoot feel type. I'm starting my third consecutive pair since 2013. As long as these shoes are available, I'll never wear anything else.

I set a goal of 350 miles on my Nike app for these shoes but I suspect I'll get many more than that before they are ready for sneaker heaven. I'm just starting to get into serious runs (a few weeks shy of my 49th birthday) and found these recommended on a website. They certainly are lightweight and fit very well. My first run took me 6.6 miles which ispositive the most I've done to this point so right now they have been more than worth it. Nike doesn't disappoint and the free run only adds to their vast legend.

Bought these and they are comfortable, form fitting and they don’t move around. Keeps your foot snug and like the other 1,000,000 reviews, the verdict is buy, buy, buy again. You deserve these shoes. Don’t miss out on this opportunity.

It was so tight that my wife had to help me put it on. The way the tongue is connected to the inner shoe makes it a problem to put on. The arch was so hard that after walking just ten minutes my feet hurt so bad it was unbearable. I had to take them off. Then and there I knew I had to return them for a refund. I would advise not to buy shoes on line. Only buy shoes you can try on before you purchase them. Disappointed!

So, I like these running shoes so much and find them so comfortable that I ordered a new pair, but I thought I'd share a comparison of the old and new shoes so you can see how the shoes wore (with me); and their pebble collecting feature is unbeatable.Why I like them: I have flat feet and can't tolerate any arch support whatsoever. If there's the teenist amount of arch support, the pain is intense. These provide none. They're like wearing super cushy moccasins, which is the reason I initially bought them; and am eternally grateful to have them.Your pebble collection: The design of the soles are genius for collecting stones of all kinds. You won't notice them while running, but I keep a little screwdriver handy to pick away at the stones from time to time (not while I'm running but once I'm home). It's actually kinda meditative. I also have a pair for walking, and only walking, and while strolling in Potsdam, at Sanssouci, where King Frederick's paths are paved with pebbles, they must have lost at least a third of their pebbles to my shoes. Never noticed though.I'm a light runner. I might do two miles a day, 10 to 12 miles a week. I've had the blue shoes for 5 years now? Only about a third of my running is on pavement. Most of it is on paths and dirt roads (also excellent areas for pebble collectors).They will not keep your feet dry. But they also don't soak up water. I've run in the rain with them and they dry out overnight.The fit is tricky. I bought a leather version (for walking) of these shoes and had to buy a half size up from the (nylon?) mesh versions.I was tempted to give them four stars, but the unrivaled pebble collecting feature easily bumped the shoes to five.

I found a pair of these at my local Nike Factory store (size 10.5, black/anthracite color). They are VERY comfortable out of the box - the sole is soft and the feeling when putting on the shoe is similar to that of putting on an extra sock (it is snug, stretchy, and yet not too tight). The high heel tab (that supports your Achilles heel) is very soft and makes the shoe even more comfortable. Also, the shoe is very bendable/stretchable. In terms of fit, I normally wear size 10 dress shoes and size 10.5 athletic shoes. I tried both the 10 and 10.5 and felt better with the 10.5. So I would say - go with your usual athletic shoes size or go 1/2 size larger than your dress shoe size.

First off, I am an avid runner and have been running exclusively on Nike Free’s for over a decade. These shoes are comfortable, but they are moving backwards in design. Rocks and debris stick in the tread more than ever. The shoes are hotter, so my feet expand and my toes bruise more (I live in South Florida and it’s July). The back “lip” doesn’t let your runners socks cover and causes blisters. This is not the best Nike Free, but it’s better than your traditional Nike runner.  i run everyday with a long run once a week and my toes are bruised and nails black. This hasn’t happened since I stopped wearing cotton socks. Nike go back to your previous design...much better!  I love the design to natural motion as it creates a basis for less injury and will still run in these shoes, but there’s been better before this one.

The design of these shoes causes them to squeak with each and every step. It doesn't discriminate what surface you walk on, it squeaks regardless.

After a few months of wear I put on the shoes and as I tried to lace them up the lace holes ripped open. No way to fix them. Who knows? Maybe they're not even legit Nikes.

I have purchased these shoes many times for my husband in the past, the price keeps going up on this particular color. If you don't need a certain color, I would purchase the cheaper ones. (They are about half the price of this color.) This time when I received the shoes after a few days of him wearing them they began making a clicking sound every time he stepped. (Very annoying and disruptive in the workplace) I thought maybe something had gotten in the tread. We cleaned them and this did not resolve the issue. I could not return them because he had worn them. I had to purchase a second pair within a week of ordering the first pair. Very frustrating since they are over $100 pair. Hopefully you'll have better luck then us.

These Nikes are good quality, light weight, well made and exactly what I was looking for. The mesh uppers let your foot breathe. The soles provide good traction for walking or working out.

I'm not sure why I care how my feet look as I jog past total strangers, but these Revolution 5 running shoes make me feel like I pop off the page when I pound pavement. They look so good -- so streamlined and uncluttered, with the iconic Nike swoosh, a color scheme that channels the original Air Jordan shoe, and a projection of class and timelessness in an era of obnoxiously loud shoe designs.What I didn't expect at this low price point is a light, breathable, elite-performing running shoe: They offer the ample cushion I now need after a period of conspicuous consumption, and feel spring-loaded as they push back against the road or sidewalk. Fit is true to U.S. sizing with no sore feet in the break-in period.An elite running shoe in every way, and the fact they're half the price of what I'm used to spending is a massive bonus. - (Was this review of use? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)

I do not use the shoe for running but its everyday durability and comfort are excellent. What's really weird about the shoe is that this tread design (I own three pairs) creates a clicking noise as I walk, perhaps a popping after some suction action on a hard floor. But since I use the shoe for everyday, it is unlikely to be a problem for a runner.

While my son is happy with the fit and comfort, the soles are already separating from the body of the shoes after 6 weeks. He wears them for 3-4 hours a day, so I wouldn’t say that the use is out of the ordinary.  I understand that these are a low-price model of Nike, but I  expected them to hold up longer.

After wearing the new Nike revolution 5.. I am disappointed  compared to Nike revolution 3. I do like the weight of Rev. 5 but the comfort rating has dropped and the 5 shoe feels tighter on my feet all be it the same size as the 3 was. The Rev 5 has a plastic type bottom sole compared to a rubbery on the Rev 3 which to me was better.

I have always had a hard time finding shoes that are supportive for working out.  I also, have wide feet and men’s shoes seem to fit me better than women’s sizes.  When I was younger I injured my tailbone and hip and I have a harder time with not being in back pain when I walk long distances. I liked the look and feel of these shoes because they had a knit cloth, not the leather that pinches my feet together around my toes.  When I received them, I took them on a trial and walked in the for awhile.  These shoes do have some support, however, they have memory foam in them which was not supportive enough for my knees or my back.

I’m not a marathon runner and in fact I’m far from it, run about 2 miles 4-5 days a week and was looking to replace my current new balances but wanted to try something new because all I buy are NB’s. These shoes, to me, were stunning. Minute I put them on, felt comfortable, light, but the sole is deceivingly thick. But not so much that it feels like your trucking around in some basketball shoes. These also on an aesthetic level...god do they pop. I knew they were fresh as hell the moment I put them on but I got 5 compliments the first day I wore these around just to break them in. Probably going to get another pair just for walking around. I’m not some expert runner so there may be flaws to my untrained eye but I am beyond impressed with these. I go around to different brands with different athletic gear and I always wind up in one way or another going back to Nike. They’ve always had superb products and they are still at the top of their game with these shoes.

I buy the Nike Tanjun almost religiously as a workout shoe. When I couldn't find any in stock in my size I ordered these, as they seem to be the closest shoe Nike offers. They are decent shoes as far as function goes, but they will NOT stop squeaking with every step (even after 6 months of wear). Even on carpet the shoes squeak with each step.I was also sent the wrong size shoe. I noticed some discomfort while wearing these in the first week, and upon looking saw that the right shoe was a 12 instead of a 13. I assumed I got sent a box of 12s, but upon closer inspection I received two shoes of completely different sizes.

Let me start with I run a fair amount, usually five times a week totaling approximately 20ish miles. When I first received these shoes I was not happy with what I got. When I put them on there were gaps under the laces where you could see your socks, the tongue didn't cover all the way and it was very visible since they were black shoes. Maybe I have high arches or something but I was less than pleased, and then I went for a run. I can still see my socks but they are now my favorite running shoes, very comfortable, light and the sole design works very nicely for a heel to toe stride. I plan to buy another pair in a different color.

If you are running or deadlifting this is not the right shoe for you due to the sole being very thick and not ideal for those activities. But that's ok because that's not what this shoe is for. If you are looking for something dirt cheap, moderately fashionable, and durable look no further. A year later they are scuffed, dirty, but still somehow hanging on. A little part of the sole is coming off, but nothing else is coming apart. I'm tempted to wear them until they start falling apart, but it would probably take another couple years. Good buy, highly recommend.

I'm a big guy who loves to run.  I put in 30+ miles of running in a week. I usually need to change my shoes out every 3-4 months. I've used all brands and styles for running, and this was one of the better ones.  Honestly, I picked it for the look and great price. I was pleasantly surprised on the nice fit and enjoyable comfort.  They held up for the 4 months  I expected.  My kids told me I had ""nice shoe game,"" as I got many compliments.  Only downside was Amazon ran out of my size, so I bought another pair from the Nike site.

The shoes look good and fit's good.

These are amazing shoes, yet apparently some factory defect and my right shoe has a little “spike” on the outer side that really bothers as it rubs against the ankle bone.

I normally do not purchase shoes online but I found this pair with this seller and I love Nike shoes which I usually purchase through the Nike Employee Store in Beaverton Oregon, but because of the COVID-19 that store has been closed for a month and I have limited access when that store is open. I found these pair on line and the price was actually really good. The shoes fit perfectly and they are super light and great for running. What a difference. I completely recommend these shoes. If you are looking for a really light fully supportive running shoe look no further. Way to go Nike.

My husband does find these comfortable, but they do make a weird popping noise when he walks on slicker surfaces. It's so loud that you could hear it when we were walking through a busy airport.

Bought two pair. Gray ones and a red  & white pair. Wore them a couple months.  The Grey pair still comfortable wear them all the time. The red ones have a seem that started rubbing and hurts.  Not sure why same size and everything.

You can really seeing the quality of Nike's going down in recent years. You notice it in the back of the shoe. Much less material there, so much so it is even difficult to get on.

My husband loves these shoes, but with every step on a hard surface, there is a loud click or pop under the ball of the feet. It's really annoying.Hard to believe this happens from a shoe made by Nike.

Feels hard with no cushion. Although the sneakers looked nice but is not comfortable and when walked on hard surface it makes clapping sound.

Nice comfortable shoes for my husband. He normally wears a 10.5 but gets an 11 for comfort. But these were still a little tight he needed an 11.5 but he said it's livable. So I'd recommend to size up .5 -1 size. Nice runners aside from that

These have to be some of the comfiest shoes I have gotten at this price point but now comes the bad. Since the first time I took them to the gym for a run I heard a squeakiness come from them - At first I thought it was just me but it continues to happen. I wondered if it was just my sweat rubbing inside the shoe but later on found out that the rubber on the bottom was what was squeaking which happens all the time during normal use and during workouts. I used them roughly a few months before getting tired of it where the squeak drives you crazy. I’ve heard this is hit and miss with this shoe but since ive had it for a while I’m just going to find new shoes. If you get a squeaky pair have them swapped ASAP as it will NOT go away.

The packaging was terrible the show box was smashed and had no top of the box only the bottom other than that it was fine surprisingly there was no visible damage to the shoes

I never even got to wear the pair I ordered due to a shipping technicality. But considering the track record I’ve had with Nike, all the highest scores are too be expected and earned. A wise purchase :)

Runs small

For the price I paid, I thought I was going to get more comfort, a bit lighter and a more flexible sole! I am using them everyday to exercise and they are OK, but I have to express my disappointment.

I love these shoes except for one small problem. They are not slip resistant at all. The slightest lack of friction can have you fumbling. It's more for walking at a moderate pace or home use. This shoe would be perfect if there was more grip at the bottom. Other similar Nike shoe's had it so why not these?
",4,confused
"
The shoes are very comfortable, even when worn for long periods of time. They offer good support and fit snugly around my feet. However they don't last very long. After only a few months, the outsole began to separate at the toe and wear out along the inside edge. While I wear them everyday, I am gentle with my things and have not done any strenuous activity with them, even though they are marketed as athletic shoes.

Good shoes, light weight, good for a good run or walk. I drive a lot and find these uncomfortable on long hour drives

I am a woman with wide flat feet and I ordered the 8.5 mens shoes.  I've done with this with Nike shoes before, and haven't had a fit issue.  In fact, I have the Nike Mens Metcons 3 in 8.5 and use those for crossfit and those work perfectly ( except that the shoes squeak, but whatever.)  I bought this pair to use strictly for walking/running and the this particular fit is just too narrow.  About 20 minutes in, my arches and heel start to throb.  They fit like a womens width, in my opinion.  So, end of story, good for running errands, but not long walks or actual running.
",3,sad

I got a size 9 like I always do, but i think in these shoes I need a 9.5 or even a 10. They are very tight. I checked the label and indeed it is a size 9

These shoes are a game changer. I’m on my feet for 10+ hours a day. I didn’t know I needed these shoes. Great investment. Considering upgrading to vapor airs when these eventually bite the dust.

I have been running in Revolutions for years now. The 5 is a big improvement over the 4. For my foot type, the 4 climbed up too high and rubbed against my ankle. The 5 is much more comfortable. Everybody has different feet, but these definitely work nicely for the basic health-maintenance type of running that I do.

My boyfriend and I wear everything Nike, bought these for him to wear to the gym after seven months they have completely fallen apart. When he first got them they were comfortable and fit perfectly. They are very comfortable and worth the money just wish they didn’t fall apart so easily after not even a year of wearing them.

Comfortable and lightweight. However, these shoes have developed an obnoxiously lout squeak while walking. Not like, my shoes are wet, pardon the squeak, but when dry, walking on both hard and soft carpeted flooring. I've looked around and this is a fairly common complaint with a few Nike shoes, including the Monarchs.I won't be buying these shoes again and would discourage anyone from buying them unless you want people to look at you like WTF while walking through the grocery store.

I like the shoe. It’s a nice looking shoe which i use for walking, many running shoes are also Used as a walking shoe, very good support. The NIKE brand is a trusted quality product. As of now the shoe works 4 me. The only issue I had with the shoe is the toe area is slightly narrow....for my foot. I just used my shoe “stretchers”, problem solved😇😇😇

Shoes were intended for son who's 12.  Currently wears 7.5 but got 8 to account for growth.  Turns out shoes were way too small - more like size 7.

Coming from nike air pegasus and air vomeros...which were nice, this one does not have any Nike air unit. But for casual walking the dog etc, these are perfect at 1/3 the price of the high end premium nikes. The best pro about this shoe is the nike heel lock design that was also included on the Air Vomeros...best design for the heel in my opinion(easy to slip on and stays locked down in place while running or walking). Can't wait to see what the Revolution 6 will look like.

Looks good and quality is good. Feels good for walking and gym. But it’s not for running or hiking. I have ran many miles with different shoes and this one is not that type. Slow response to gravity and you could be halfway down before you know you’ve slipped. It’s also heavy which slows down your pace.

Great sneakers, but they make a weird squeaking sound. Definitely no sneaking going on in these shoes.

After 4 months of normal use, shoe is completely falling apart. Purchase from seller BusBrand Shop. Nike won’t offer support unless purchased from a Nike store. Seller has no contact information except number for Nike!! Good luck if you purchase on Amazon, the normal 2 year Nike warranty from manufacture date apparently goes out the window if you have any problems outside the Amazon return window.

I thought I ordered it 7.5 wide, but I was wrong. I forgot it didn't have a size in wide. The shoe was fine. It fit good. I just wish it was shipped differently. It came in a bag, but it would have been nice if it was shipped in a box.

First pair i order is way to small, i ordered the same size i have worn most of my life. No big deal so i return them and order the next size up. They come clearly used full of some pet hair and grime on the bottom and then rip within a week. I return those and order another pair hoping it was just bad luck. Nope, the same shoes come clearly used again and this time the size up from what im used to is then too small. Last time im trying with these. Highly reccomend you find another shoe if youre thinking of getting these.

So I really liked these shoes. Super light and comfortable. I got the white with the light blue check. The material is super soft. I would recommend to get a darker color. My German Shepard put her paw on the front and it was EXCEPTIONALLY hard to get it off. The material really absorbs the littlest bit of dirt. They feel and look good. I know that’s the main point of shoes along with the cost. I’d say just be careful when and where you wear these. Unless you just don’t care about that.

shoes look great regarding red on white. worried about quality in long term though. the glue and sewing  / seams look cheap, discoloration on heel. i've attached a couple of photos and highlighted the issues. shoes are wide enough for me in this size so I don't have to buy wide-specific. huge problem - shoes rub against my inside ankles enough to irritate me when i first put them on. once i get running, sensation goes away. shipment arrived in poor quality - rubber bands and dented, torn box. will update review in January 2022 and revisit rating.

The shoe is comfortable and fits as expected.  The fit is on par with all other Nike brand shoes.  I am not a runner, but at least I look good wearing these.Update:  I had to return these shoes for a quality issue.  The shoes fit fine and were comfortable, but the right shoe was making a clicking sound when walking.  There was something loose within the sole.  At least Amazon has a good return policy.

First some context... I have a knee injury,  when I purchase shoes they normally last me 3 to 4 years. This Nike shoes I purchased in May of 2020, they started to fall apart before Jan 2021. I live in Texas and like I said a knee injury that prevents me from doing a lot. The shoes bottoms do not wear out in my shoes as I don't drag my feet since it would cause me a lot more pain. The shoe soles is what wears out and causes me to replace my shoesProblem - The shoe bottoms started detaching them selves from the rest of the shoe around Nov 2020. I used gel super glue because it was just a tiny corner that came up ...at first.  since the bottoms are put on like a puzzle set some of the corners face the front of the shoe causing me to stumble when walking. Its now May 2021 and they have become on usable almost and I'm looking to buy some different shoes now.Hope that helps

As a teacher, I’m on my feet most of the day. Fortunately, we are able to wear comfortable shoes like this. The shoes are wonderful.

I was expecting a little more from the shoe, comfort level is just fine but a far cry from the last pair I bought from nike. These are pretty stiff overall and don't seem to add any bounce to your steps leading to a flatter feel.

Not sure if this is typical for the model, or if I just got a bum pair, but every few steps taken they seem to pop somewhere in the bottom. It sounds like a quieter version of a bang snap, and occurs on each shoe semi randomly. Other than that the shoes are comfortable, and look fine, there just must be some kind of air pocket between the adhesive and the bottoms of the shoes or something.

The plastic tread on these shoes creates a 'bubble' that pops every time you step. It's like a suction cup to the ground. If you ever walk or run on flat surfaces, I hope you don't mind otherwise it'll drive you insane. I've noticed that it impacts the way I walk/run as well.They are extremely comfortable, however, so if you mostly run on grass/dirt they're probably a good find.

These are very comfortable and great for my workouts.  However, after about 3 weeks, the left shoe started to make a crack noise on every step as if a rock was stuck in the bottom.

From a performance standpoint, they are great.  Craziest thing how both seem to have broken somehow and make this noise.

I didn't believe the reviews about the loud popping sound and bought these shoes anyway. I was wrong. There is a very loud popping sound every single step when my right foot comes off the floor. It's consistent with every footstep on concrete, hardwoods or any solid floor. It's loud like an annoying bubblegum smacker in a meditation chapel. My spouse told me to get rid of these shoes because they are so terrible. They are definitely comfortable but this noise is s deal breaker.

While these shoes look great and fit perfectly fine, they have several issues. These are some of the most uncomfortable shoes I've ever worn. If I try to wear them, after about an hour my feet already hurt. They have almost no support at all and feel like I'm walking on bare concrete with each step. They also make this loud clicking sound with every step. It doesn't matter what I'm walking on, grass, turf, concrete, tile, wood. Click, click, click.

I had the product for week now and lifted several times with it, and have gone on a walk. Its comfortable and fits as expected, no noticeable wear and tear, but the problem is going at anything more than a jog make it feel very uncomfortable.

My grandson won't wear anything else.  Very comfortable and nice looking.  However, since it's a fabric shoe, it doesn't last forever especially on a 12 year old's foot everyday.  That's not really a drawback since kid's feet grow so fast.

I have bought multiple generations of Nike Revolution sneakers and love them. After wearing these revolution 5 sneakers for a year...they still squeak. The traction has little circles that act like suction cups so it's really bad on waxed flooring. So if you want to draw attention to yourself and a lot of snickering about your squeaky shoes....buy them.They are awesome shoes in every other way. It's a shame.

The shoes are functional and comfortable, but after only 1 month of use both shoes make a terribly annoying squeaky sound when walking on hard surfaces.  It doesn't happen on carpet or outside on the grass/dirt.  I will not buy another pair of these shoes.  I would have given a solid 4 star rating if they didn't make such a soul-disturbing sound.

This is the 3rd of 4 pairs of Nike running shoes that I bought in the past year that started to speak after wearing them for about 2 weeks.  The sound is quite loud and does not go away.

My son and I own a pair. Within weeks one pair of shoes started to click and the tread started coming off both of them within 1 month. I was out of my return window so I called Nike to open a claim. They don’t send a return label to send the shoe back for inspection and I was quoted $30 to ship it back through the UPS Store. These shoes will not last. It seems like Nike makes cheap shoes and sells them for a premium price now because their products don’t seem to last.

First off, these shoes are insanely comfortable, and fit perfectly. However, the ""bubble"" traction pattern on the bottom of the shoe makes a loud snap / pop when you walk, at literally the volume of popping bubble packaging. Numerous people have commented on this, it's completely unmistakable. This goes for nearly all surfaces. Really odd design choice, or maybe it was just my size (12.5).

The size was probably a half size larger than what was indicated (US 10). It's the first pair of Nike I got that didn't fit perfectly. The collar is so stiff that walking around my home for a few minutes left me in pain and red marks where the collar rubbed my skin (which may be due to the shoes being too large).

The right shoe has a defect in the sole that causes a popping sound every time I took a step, very annoying.  And unbelievable that two pairs in a row had the same issue.

I bought these to work in, but they came to me just unwrapped in a box. When you buy shoes, they come with paper stuffed inside and materials to hold their shape, etc. These arrived already laced in the box. It was like someone took the shoes off and sent them to me. I was HIGHLY disappointed in this purchase. I want another pair but let them come to me NEW, not having had anyone else's foot in them!

I guess Nike has a series of small behind shoes. I thought it was an accident refunded my money and bought from nike... I bought the wrong size and luckily I did because they fit.  Moral of the story ...order this shoe at least a size and a half or 2 up.

I was very happy with the shoes until the third week of wearing them a LOUD suction cup sound started during each step! This was happening while walking on a variety of different outdoor surfaces so it is the shoe, not something btw the shoe and the ground.  Sending back, my wife was embarrassed to walk beside me!

Received this order recently (March 2021). Have worn the shoes less that 10 times and the right shoe is already popping like there is a break in the sole.  Which causes me to change my walk/run  to stop the popping which eventually causes foot pain.  They don’t make products like they used to.
",1,sad
"
The popping/squeaking/clicking sound is from the cheap glue on the bottom of the thin insole.  It’s still a comfortable shoe without the insole, but I just added some baby powder between the insole and inside bottom of the shoe and it got rid of the annoying popping sound.

These shoes were great at first, but they broke down very, very quickly. The shoe has a rigid plastic piece behind the fabric where the heel rests. The fabric has been cut but the plastic and now whenever I use these shoes, I get scratching but the internal plastic bit.That made what would have been an excellent running shoe into an unusable piece of trash. I paid too much for this.
",1,angry
"
The shoes seem to be low quality. The glue is very visible and my shoe even came with a white stain. After one fitness workout. I can now see a little opening in the glue. These shoes are very low quality. And the fit is a little tight. I suggest getting a half size bigger. I’m scared to see how these shoes will hold up on the long run. Won’t order shoes on amazon anymore.

Right out of the box the shoes were filled with dog hair.

They were great at first.  But after about a week, they started to squeak at almost every step I took.  It seemed like on each step, air was forced out of air pockets within the soles. Drive my walking companion nuts.

First 13D I’ve had a fitting issue with.  Gave to grandson. Simply too tight. Beautiful shoe.

This is the second pair that I've had a problem with. The first pair I bought for my husband for Christmas. Within a couple of weeks one of the shoes started making a popping sound when he walks, like an air bubble was in the sole. We were beyond the return time, so I just bought a second. The second pair did the exact same thing. They lasted a little bit longer, but still too late to return them.

I dont know if the JV in the label means something but these shoes DID NOT FIT!! I bought them for my boyfriend as a bday gift.

I didn't like this shoe and DO NOT  recommend for anyone to buy it.The cloth material is cheap and of poor quality. After wearing them a few times it was worn out at the toe level a whole ensued. After a few times wearing I will have to through them away, not at all what I expected of Nike.

Absolute Garbage!! I purchased one pair and they began clicking after my first run with them. My run was on concrete only, no dirt or rocks. I returned and thought I would try them one more time. The second pair began clicking after my second short run. The click is so loud that my friend asked what that noise was when I walk. I’ve seen other reviews saying the same thing.

So who knows if they are good or not because they have to be returned. With all my extra time.

It's been a while since I bought these shoes, so all hopes of getting them replaced have evaporated, but it's always good to warn other potential buyers.Less than a month after purchase, despite fairly light use, in both shoes, the plastic support that keeps the back of the shoe rigid started piercing through the fabric like the world's most anticlimactic Xenomorph. It drew blood for a while (also much like a Xenomorph) as the plastic split in various places. This made for a very unpleasant experience, both putting them on and walking. Although the pain of constantly scraping my heels against cheap synthetic material was a great opportunity to ponder the torment of daily life, I could imagine subtler ways to convey the message. This mirrors what PCR25 said in their one-star review.Today, several months after purchase, the pain in my heels has diminished, perhaps because the protruding blades helped me get rid of some unnecessary nerve endings. While this means the shoes are more comfortable than before, they have been relegated to the role of gardening shoes.All in all, these were a step down from the Revolution 4, which lasted much longer for me but could not be used as a makeshift bayonet. I'm now trying my luck with the Nike Flex Control TR4, which have shown a lot more promise so far than these did.

They were in great condition.

I love these sneakers except for one significant issue that pretty much resigns them to the garbage bin. As I see now in other reviews, this model makes a loud popping sound (in my case only on the left one) whenever they flex. All surfaces, running, walking etc. It sounds like there is super sticky gum on the bottom. Evidently it is a design flaw or inferior glue or something like that. Not sure why - but it sucks. Fair warning...

Shoes look and feel great. But you will lose your mind wearing these. Non stop obnoxious squeaking every step. People hear me walking down the hall from a mile away. These are on the same level as SpongeBob’s squeaky boots.

I was considering these shoes but was iffy with all the complaints of the popping sound. I decided to try them on first so I went to Famous Footwear. I tried them on and they seemed ok so I bought them (cheaper than Amazon at 64$)  On the second day the loud popping sound started on the left shoe. I will be returning, thankfully they offer 30 day refunds!

The heal of the shoe isn't level, therefore uncomfortable. Thinking this could cause undo injury, the return is necessary!

I thought they were seconds. Both shoes had a dot of glue on them. Not going to due that again.

I would not get these shoes. I know three different people and myself who have an issue with the shoe making a loud clicking noise every time I take a step as if there is a rock or something stuck inside the shoe. Nike does nothing to fix the problem even though many people have experienced the issue so I suggest spending your money on a different shoe by Nike or a different company all together.

Shoes are excellent and comfortable but the right shoe has a loud popping sound that is noticeable by people around you.  I returned and got a second pair and the second day wearing them (not working out or anything strenuous, just walking) the shoe began making the loud popping sound.  I will have to return for a different type of shoe.  2 pair in 3 weeks with the same problem is a defect in quality.

Shoes are very comfortable, if you can stand the popping noise the sole makes when you walk. Bad design, defective, whatever it is, I don't recommend for the noise. Multiple low reviews state the same.

I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend, they run small. He didn’t want to go through the hassle of returning them so I wasted my money and he can’t wear them.

The shoes came in a box that was crushed. The shoes did not have the usual tissue wrapped around them (it was all flattened underneath them) and there was no packaging inside the shoes to hold their shape. It appeared that these were used/opened by someone previously. These were purchased as a gift and of too poor quality to give.

I will miss these shoes. A few months after my purchase, Hurricane Ida struck and the flooding raw sewage ruined these shoes. They are cozy and easy to slip into, and very breatheable. The pattern is pleasing to the eye and unique. (This is the black and anthracite redwhite version). I wish I'd bought 11.5 wide. A little pricey for the action, however, and there is a notable CLICK sound from walking as the sole has a different pattern from the norm.

I expected a high-quality and super comfortable shoe. I've been using them for almost 2 months and it seems lackluster for what the Nike brand portrays. From just taking out the garbage to walking all around SOHO/Manhattan all day, for days, I found them only slightly comfortable. I did the same thing with some cheap shoes previously and found similar comfort. I had to throw those shoes away after a year, let's hope these are at least more durable.

I was scared to buy these. Never bought shoes online, and the shoes I own are all slight different sizes (+ or - a half size). But it fit as expected perfectly. The sole really made my light jogs with the dog much easier on my shins, and help fix my bad leg work.The only reason I'm knocking a star is, in their aim to make it as light as possible, the top material is very thin. While I only use these for occasional jogs, I can imagine anyone wearing them on a daily basis, or around town, would quickly have them be torn or worn fast. For the price, I feel like they could have gone a bit thicker.

I purchased this sneaker because I want to start walking more often. I like the clean monochromatic look, as I don't appreciate colorful sneakers. When they came in I thought that were just what I was looking for. The good: it's a light pair of sneakers, comfortable but a bit to snug for my taste. I've never owned a pair of sneakers of this type, so I wasn't sure if they were supposed to fit this way or if they run on the tighter side. The bad: Now, if you kept these and broke them in, then the other factor to consider is that because they are manufactured with light woven materials. The shell is very light, almost like a synthetic sweater and when you take a step you can see your toe (in this case my finger) kinda poke through the surface. The last pic reflects what I'm trying to describe. I don't know if this could be an issue later on but I figured, return the item asap because this model is almost what I wanted, but not quite. Had the top shell material been slightly tougher I would have kept them, I don't know how long they could have possibly lasted given that they are extremely light. These are extremely light, snug fitting pair of walking or jogging sneakers, toughness, not so much. I seriously don't see these lasting a significant amount of time. Hope this helps. Inconclusion I did return them because I wasn't 100% sold on them but they may work for you. If you don't mind the protruding toe lol.

For anyone wondering about these for work.I work a 12-hour shift at Wal-Mart DC.. These are comfortable as f***. They breathe so the smell of a warehouse worker doesn't stick.They are stylish too, As a 24 yr old guy I dress very well.. All the time... I didnt care how the shoes would look on me at work but when I looked down and seen a fresh pair of these on my feet.. Not gonna lie' I was taken aback, I gasped at the freshness.TLDR.. Great shoes, Comfortable, they run Nike size so pick your shoe size according to what size of nikes you have in your closet. All in All.. This is actually a bang for your buck.

After only a few wears, walking and driving only, the right shoe makes a popping noise as if there's an air bubble trapped where the sole has started to come away. This drives me mad when I'm walking so I don't wear them anymore. Dissapointed because Nike are a much more expensive make than all others. I'll stick to Adidas in future.

Light as, comfy, nice fit, durable and when they were new felt like I was walking on clouds.Had them for a long time now, use them as work trainers most often. Also general walking shoes really.

Love these trainers. They are comfortable and stylish with good build quality and competitive price on Amazon. You can't really go wrong if you're looking for a pair of trainers for everyday use that goes with most outfits. My only gripe is that the back of the heel does wear out rather quickly, however, this is a problem with most trainers and not just Nike, so would recommend.

Bought them at a discounted price, circa £36, and for that cost it is a good value for money.The sole is harder than expected, a light, flexible rubber but a bit harder than expected, but nevertheless comfortable. It is also a bit inflexible around the acchiles area.Used them on a trip around Amsterdam where I walked and cycled quite a bit and the shoes surprised me, so giving them a 4 stars and if I could I would give them a 4.5 stars due to the cost/value I got.

Nike shoes are usually smaller than the regular size that I wear. So bought the size 9.5 usually I wear a size 9.Cushioning is on the harder side and it has less responsiveness. It doesn't flex much. I wouldn't advice wearing this for long distance runs. It's breathable and it's nice for regular use.Also this is the Nike Revolution 5. It's not mentioned in the product page.Summary: You get what you paid for. If you want a shoe for running and from Nike look into the 5000rs range.

I have purchased these shoes many times for my husband in the past, the price keeps going up on this particular color. If you don't need a certain color, I would purchase the cheaper ones. (They are about half the price of this color.) This time when I received the shoes after a few days of him wearing them they began making a clicking sound every time he stepped. (Very annoying and disruptive in the workplace) I thought maybe something had gotten in the tread. We cleaned them and this did not resolve the issue. I could not return them because he had worn them. I had to purchase a second pair within a week of ordering the first pair. Very frustrating since they are over $100 pair. Hopefully you'll have better luck then us.

I'm not sure why I care how my feet look as I jog past total strangers, but these Revolution 5 running shoes make me feel like I pop off the page when I pound pavement. They look so good -- so streamlined and uncluttered, with the iconic Nike swoosh, a color scheme that channels the original Air Jordan shoe, and a projection of class and timelessness in an era of obnoxiously loud shoe designs.What I didn't expect at this low price point is a light, breathable, elite-performing running shoe: They offer the ample cushion I now need after a period of conspicuous consumption, and feel spring-loaded as they push back against the road or sidewalk. Fit is true to U.S. sizing with no sore feet in the break-in period.An elite running shoe in every way, and the fact they're half the price of what I'm used to spending is a massive bonus. - (Was this review of use? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!)

I do not use the shoe for running but its everyday durability and comfort are excellent. What's really weird about the shoe is that this tread design (I own three pairs) creates a clicking noise as I walk, perhaps a popping after some suction action on a hard floor. But since I use the shoe for everyday, it is unlikely to be a problem for a runner.

While my son is happy with the fit and comfort, the soles are already separating from the body of the shoes after 6 weeks. He wears them for 3-4 hours a day, so I wouldn’t say that the use is out of the ordinary.  I understand that these are a low-price model of Nike, but I  expected them to hold up longer.

After wearing the new Nike revolution 5.. I am disappointed  compared to Nike revolution 3. I do like the weight of Rev. 5 but the comfort rating has dropped and the 5 shoe feels tighter on my feet all be it the same size as the 3 was. The Rev 5 has a plastic type bottom sole compared to a rubbery on the Rev 3 which to me was better.

I have always had a hard time finding shoes that are supportive for working out.  I also, have wide feet and men’s shoes seem to fit me better than women’s sizes.  When I was younger I injured my tailbone and hip and I have a harder time with not being in back pain when I walk long distances. I liked the look and feel of these shoes because they had a knit cloth, not the leather that pinches my feet together around my toes.  When I received them, I took them on a trial and walked in the for awhile.  These shoes do have some support, however, they have memory foam in them which was not supportive enough for my knees or my back.

I’m not a marathon runner and in fact I’m far from it, run about 2 miles 4-5 days a week and was looking to replace my current new balances but wanted to try something new because all I buy are NB’s. These shoes, to me, were stunning. Minute I put them on, felt comfortable, light, but the sole is deceivingly thick. But not so much that it feels like your trucking around in some basketball shoes. These also on an aesthetic level...god do they pop. I knew they were fresh as hell the moment I put them on but I got 5 compliments the first day I wore these around just to break them in. Probably going to get another pair just for walking around. I’m not some expert runner so there may be flaws to my untrained eye but I am beyond impressed with these. I go around to different brands with different athletic gear and I always wind up in one way or another going back to Nike. They’ve always had superb products and they are still at the top of their game with these shoes.

I buy the Nike Tanjun almost religiously as a workout shoe. When I couldn't find any in stock in my size I ordered these, as they seem to be the closest shoe Nike offers. They are decent shoes as far as function goes, but they will NOT stop squeaking with every step (even after 6 months of wear). Even on carpet the shoes squeak with each step.I was also sent the wrong size shoe. I noticed some discomfort while wearing these in the first week, and upon looking saw that the right shoe was a 12 instead of a 13. I assumed I got sent a box of 12s, but upon closer inspection I received two shoes of completely different sizes.

Let me start with I run a fair amount, usually five times a week totaling approximately 20ish miles. When I first received these shoes I was not happy with what I got. When I put them on there were gaps under the laces where you could see your socks, the tongue didn't cover all the way and it was very visible since they were black shoes. Maybe I have high arches or something but I was less than pleased, and then I went for a run. I can still see my socks but they are now my favorite running shoes, very comfortable, light and the sole design works very nicely for a heel to toe stride. I plan to buy another pair in a different color.

If you are running or deadlifting this is not the right shoe for you due to the sole being very thick and not ideal for those activities. But that's ok because that's not what this shoe is for. If you are looking for something dirt cheap, moderately fashionable, and durable look no further. A year later they are scuffed, dirty, but still somehow hanging on. A little part of the sole is coming off, but nothing else is coming apart. I'm tempted to wear them until they start falling apart, but it would probably take another couple years. Good buy, highly recommend.

The shoes look good and fit's good. The only problem is there is a seam on the right shoe that protrudes a bit on the back of the heal, requiring heavy socks to prevent discomfort.  7 months later The right shoe developed a click INSIDE the sole.

These are amazing shoes, yet apparently some factory defect and my right shoe has a little “spike” on the outer side that really bothers as it rubs against the ankle bone.

I love these shoes except for one small problem. They are not slip resistant at all. The slightest lack of friction can have you fumbling. It's more for walking at a moderate pace or home use.

The shoes are very comfortable, even when worn for long periods of time. They offer good support and fit snugly around my feet. However they don't last very long.

I have been running in Revolutions for years now. The 5 is a big improvement over the 4. For my foot type, the 4 climbed up too high and rubbed against my ankle. The 5 is much more comfortable.

So I really liked these shoes. Super light and comfortable. I got the white with the light blue check. The material is super soft. I would recommend to get a darker color. My German Shepard put her paw on the front and it was EXCEPTIONALLY hard to get it off. The material really absorbs the littlest bit of dirt. They feel and look good. I know that’s the main point of shoes along with the cost. I’d say just be careful when and where you wear these. Unless you just don’t care about that.

shoes look great regarding red on white. worried about quality in long term though. the glue and sewing  / seams look cheap, discoloration on heel. i've attached a couple of photos and highlighted the issues. shoes are wide enough for me in this size so I don't have to buy wide-specific. huge problem - shoes rub against my inside ankles enough to irritate me when i first put them on. once i get running, sensation goes away. shipment arrived in poor quality - rubber bands and dented, torn box. will update review in January 2022 and revisit rating.

These look similar to h the e epic react 2, which I have and love. They have similar looking soles. But the soles on these shoes is rock hard. It’s almost comical how stiff and plastic feeling it is. The other soles are extremely soft. Sent these back right away.

bought to replace my Nike Zoom shoes.  the bottoms on these are hard enough they make a noise like 70's films did when a person is walking down a sidewalk.  they look good and are fine for wearing the store and such but are not cushiony in the least for running.  going back to nike zoom.

The shoe is comfortable and fits as expected.  The fit is on par with all other Nike brand shoes.  I am not a runner, but at least I look good wearing these.Update:  I had to return these shoes for a quality issue.  The shoes fit fine and were comfortable, but the right shoe was making a clicking sound when walking.  There was something loose within the sole.  At least Amazon has a good return policy.

First some context... I have a knee injury,  when I purchase shoes they normally last me 3 to 4 years. This Nike shoes I purchased in May of 2020, they started to fall apart before Jan 2021. I live in Texas and like I said a knee injury that prevents me from doing a lot. The shoes bottoms do not wear out in my shoes as I don't drag my feet since it would cause me a lot more pain. The shoe soles is what wears out and causes me to replace my shoesProblem - The shoe bottoms started detaching them selves from the rest of the shoe around Nov 2020. I used gel super glue because it was just a tiny corner that came up ...at first.  since the bottoms are put on like a puzzle set some of the corners face the front of the shoe causing me to stumble when walking. Its now May 2021 and they have become on usable almost and I'm looking to buy some different shoes now.Hope that helps

Have been wearing this shoe for a month now & it is very uncomfortable. It is rubbing on the heal of my foot & causing me great discomfort throughout the day even when I take them off. They feel like they are too small & are not breaking in well.

Great shoes, light weight but good support. The shoes tend to run a size small. I usually wear a 10 and got these in 11 and they fit well.

Everyday wear. Something broken inside one sole on day one. A week later the other one broke. There is a popping sound with every step. It sounds like I’ve stepped in gum and the shoes are sticking to a sidewalk.

As a teacher, I’m on my feet most of the day. Fortunately, we are able to wear comfortable shoes like this. The shoes are wonderful.

I was expecting a little more from the shoe, comfort level is just fine but a far cry from the last pair I bought from nike. These are pretty stiff overall and don't seem to add any bounce to your steps leading to a flatter feel. I primarily jog and walk around with these and they do the job but I doubt I would buy this pair again.

Not sure if this is typical for the model, or if I just got a bum pair, but every few steps taken they seem to pop somewhere in the bottom. It sounds like a quieter version of a bang snap, and occurs on each shoe semi randomly. Other than that the shoes are comfortable, and look fine, there just must be some kind of air pocket between the adhesive and the bottoms of the shoes or something.

The plastic tread on these shoes creates a 'bubble' that pops every time you step. It's like a suction cup to the ground. If you ever walk or run on flat surfaces, I hope you don't mind otherwise it'll drive you insane. I've noticed that it impacts the way I walk/run as well.They are extremely comfortable, however, so if you mostly run on grass/dirt they're probably a good find.

I have bought multiple generations of Nike Revolution sneakers and love them. After wearing these revolution 5 sneakers for a year...they still squeak. The traction has little circles that act like suction cups so it's really bad on waxed flooring.

The shoes are functional and comfortable, but after only 1 month of use both shoes make a terribly annoying squeaky sound when walking on hard surfaces.

This is the 3rd of 4 pairs of Nike running shoes that I bought in the past year that started to speak after wearing them for about 2 weeks.  The sound is quite loud and does not go away.

I purchased this shoe for my yearly replacement shoe (I usually buy the Nike Air Pegasus) which actually looks like a Nike and feels like one.

I ordered these because I have been wearing Nike shoes for years and always have enjoyed them.  However, I got two pairs in a row with the same defect.

The popping/squeaking/clicking sound is from the cheap glue on the bottom of the thin insole.  It’s still a comfortable shoe without the insole, but I just added some baby powder between the insole and inside bottom of the shoe and it got rid of the annoying popping sound.

It's been a while since I bought these shoes, so all hopes of getting them replaced have evaporated, but it's always good to warn other potential buyers.Less than a month after purchase, despite fairly light use, in both shoes, the plastic support that keeps the back of the shoe rigid started piercing through the fabric like the world's most anticlimactic Xenomorph. It drew blood for a while (also much like a Xenomorph) as the plastic split in various places. This made for a very unpleasant experience, both putting them on and walking. Although the pain of constantly scraping my heels against cheap synthetic material was a great opportunity to ponder the torment of daily life, I could imagine subtler ways to convey the message. This mirrors what PCR25 said in their one-star review.Today, several months after purchase, the pain in my heels has diminished, perhaps because the protruding blades helped me get rid of some unnecessary nerve endings. While this means the shoes are more comfortable than before, they have been relegated to the role of gardening shoes.All in all, these were a step down from the Revolution 4, which lasted much longer for me but could not be used as a makeshift bayonet. I'm now trying my luck with the Nike Flex Control TR4, which have shown a lot more promise so far than these did.

I love these sneakers except for one significant issue that pretty much resigns them to the garbage bin. As I see now in other reviews, this model makes a loud popping sound (in my case only on the left one) whenever they flex. All surfaces, running, walking etc. It sounds like there is super sticky gum on the bottom. Evidently it is a design flaw or inferior glue or something like that. Not sure why - but it sucks. Fair warning...

Shoes look and feel great. But you will lose your mind wearing these. Non stop obnoxious squeaking every step. People hear me walking down the hall from a mile away. These are on the same level as SpongeBob’s squeaky boots.

I was considering these shoes but was iffy with all the complaints of the popping sound. I decided to try them on first so I went to Famous Footwear. I tried them on and they seemed ok so I bought them (cheaper than Amazon at 64$)  On the second day the loud popping sound started on the left shoe. I will be returning, thankfully they offer 30 day refunds!

They look great and feel comfortable. But the left shoe makes a clicking/popping sound with every step. Pretty embarrassing at the gym, and not what I’d expect from Nike.

I thought they were seconds. Both shoes had a dot of glue on them. Not going to due that again.

I would not get these shoes. I know three different people and myself who have an issue with the shoe making a loud clicking noise every time I take a step as if there is a rock or something stuck inside the shoe. Nike does nothing to fix the problem even though many people have experienced the issue so I suggest spending your money on a different shoe by Nike or a different company all together.

First time ordering shoes on-line. Fit good and they are comfortable. After a month or so the right one started having a “popping” noise but could just be me working in them and not the shoes. Would deff buy again.

I was scared to buy these. Never bought shoes online, and the shoes I own are all slight different sizes (+ or - a half size). But it fit as expected perfectly. The sole really made my light jogs with the dog much easier on my shins, and help fix my bad leg work.The only reason I'm knocking a star is, in their aim to make it as light as possible, the top material is very thin. While I only use these for occasional jogs, I can imagine anyone wearing them on a daily basis, or around town, would quickly have them be torn or worn fast. For the price, I feel like they could have gone a bit thicker.

I purchased this sneaker because I want to start walking more often. I like the clean monochromatic look, as I don't appreciate colorful sneakers. When they came in I thought that were just what I was looking for. The good: it's a light pair of sneakers, comfortable but a bit to snug for my taste. I've never owned a pair of sneakers of this type, so I wasn't sure if they were supposed to fit this way or if they run on the tighter side. The bad: Now, if you kept these and broke them in, then the other factor to consider is that because they are manufactured with light woven materials. The shell is very light, almost like a synthetic sweater and when you take a step you can see your toe (in this case my finger) kinda poke through the surface. The last pic reflects what I'm trying to describe. I don't know if this could be an issue later on but I figured, return the item asap because this model is almost what I wanted, but not quite. Had the top shell material been slightly tougher I would have kept them, I don't know how long they could have possibly lasted given that they are extremely light. These are extremely light, snug fitting pair of walking or jogging sneakers, toughness, not so much. I seriously don't see these lasting a significant amount of time. Hope this helps. Inconclusion I did return them because I wasn't 100% sold on them but they may work for you. If you don't mind the protruding toe lol.

Bought them at a discounted price, circa £36, and for that cost it is a good value for money.The sole is harder than expected, a light, flexible rubber but a bit harder than expected, but nevertheless comfortable. It is also a bit inflexible around the acchiles area.Used them on a trip around Amsterdam where I walked and cycled quite a bit and the shoes surprised me, so giving them a 4 stars and if I could I would give them a 4.5 stars due to the cost/value I got.

Okay so...these running shoes are a bit of a mystery. They feel firmer than other shoes (as in the sole is firm) which would make you think you'd maybe not have as comfortable an experience, but if anything my running is faster and easier with these on.

Nike shoes are usually smaller than the regular size that I wear. So bought the size 9.5 usually I wear a size 9.Cushioning is on the harder side and it has less responsiveness. It doesn't flex much. I wouldn't advice wearing this for long distance runs. It's breathable and it's nice for regular use.Also this is the Nike Revolution 5. It's not mentioned in the product page.Summary: You get what you paid for. If you want a shoe for running and from Nike look into the 5000rs range.

Really narrow and tight to where my feet are bulging up on the front mesh when I’m doing leg presses, one star less.

Fantastic shoe, bought specifically for the zip fastening. Had read how nike had worked with disabilities to design fashionable functional footwear and couldn’t wait for these. The no-tie zip/velcro function is brilliant for poor motor skills but what sets this apart from velcro shoes (aside from being adult sizing) is that the zip goes around to the heel meaning people with limited foot function don’t need much effort to slip these on or off. User with Dyspraxia loved these and couldn’t wait to show them off- have ordered another colour and hope they’re popular enough to be available for years to come.Can not comment on durability yet as too new but hoping there’s longevity in them too - zip pull ‘may’ be a weak point but suspect feet will grow prior to this.

I’ve had these shoes all of about 2 weeks before i noticed an annoying noise when I was walking home one day. I brushed it off thinking it was just because the bottom of the shoes were wet but a couple days later it began making that same noise again, this time more often. Gradually as the days passed the squeaking became louder and even started happening when they were not wet, what baffled me was that it squeaked even when they were dry and I was walking on carpet???? I have to imagine it’s due to the poor design of the sole but at the end of the day, don’t buy these, there’s a reason there was such a good deal on them and it’s because they’re crap and no one else wanted to buy them.

Wore these trainers for approx 2 weeks and all of a sudden they started to squeak whilst I was walking. Not a little squeak, the loudest squeak you can imagine. In both trainers.

Beware, the size table is incorrect for this model! It says sole length is 27.9 for size 45EU, whereas in reality it's whopping 29cm! Seriously, buying shoes online is nothing but frustration. Why does every single model have its own size grid?! Standards? Never heard of them!Shoes themselves are OK. Would've been very comfy to wear if my feet were 1cm bigger.

i dont ask much from a trainer but, when i walk i don't want a squeak. i thought it may be the way i walk but when i returned form holiday i was walking along the corridor of the airport and i could hear, squeak, squeak , squeak. i tried to walk differently but the squeak was still there. then i noticed in front of me walking was someone with the same Nike shoes, it was his shoes that were making the squeak as well. shame, they look good and fit well. but the squeak will take away.

I always liked the 1990's Nike Air Max sneakers & rececntly I got 2 pairs of these latest Nike Air Max 2090's. They are comfortable to wear all day long. Uppers are nylon/leather mix with soft rubber soles for the pair. Shoe laces are really thin for Nike sneakers, but I got better shoe laces already for these Nike sneakers. Fit is ""as expected"" & are very well-made after over 5 months of near daily wear & still wearing them as of today. They are holding up well & comfortable for all-day wear. Got another pair ordered of the same color last week. Excellent Nike sneakers. 5 stars.

Ordered UK 10.5, they say UK 10.5 on the label, fit more like 10's, maybe a bit smaller than that, I'd go up a half size, never had this issue with Nike before.

They size a little small. If you want a snug fit go for your normal size. If your feet are on the wide side, or you don't like a close fit, i'd suggest half a size up... quality and comfort is great for sub £40....

This (NIKE Men's Revolution 6 Nn Running Shoe) is comfy to wear but I just cant get over how annoying the squeaking of both shoes are when walking. It has a kind of grid grip on the bottom of each shoe and I can only imagine that is the culprit of the constant squeaking noises they make.
",2,sad
"
Bought these for running so was annoyed when I realised they use zip and velcro fasten rather than laces (it was my bad - quick reread of ad and it's clear in the description). However, they are really light and a fairly snug fit so this hasn't been a problem yet (once I got over the trainers not feeling 'lace tight').The test will be how long the velcro lasts and how rigid they are after getting wet.They look good too!

The left trainer developed a very loud & annoying squeak on the second time I wore them . It so dad I don’t wear . It’s fine for the first 30 mins or so. Then squeaks fire the rest of the time I wear them.

Wore these trainers for approx 2 weeks and all of a sudden they started to squeak whilst I was walking. Not a little squeak, the loudest squeak you can imagine. In both trainers. Like when you have a trolley at Sainsburys and a wheel squeaks. It’s loud, everyone can hear and you’re getting judged.Apart from that they are ok.

I had these shoes before so I knew what I was expecting, I love these shoes it's clean and very comfortable but one thing I didn't like about how it came was that if you live far and these shoes don't come in a box it just comes in the Nike box and when I saw the box I thought the shoes were destroyed, but the shoe was fine but had to throw away the Nike box tho. so don't be surprised if your box is messed up the shoes will prob be fine.

I ordered these Nike shoes on August 18th.  I did not open them until last night, November 13, 2022 when I gave them to my grandson as a present.  This is what we found.  The right shoe is in good order.  The left shoe is very dirty as you can see around the inside of the top of the heel. Both shoes show size 9 on the inside label but the left shoe is at least one size smaller than the right shoe.  This is so odd!

I got this shoe over the summer. I really didnt need it right away, I got it just incase if I need a white shoe. So I didn’t try it right away. When I tried later, I found out it was too big. It was also too late for me to return it. I wear size 10 or 10.5 depending on the shoe style and brand. This shoe was very big, I gave nephew who wears size 12 and he even said this is big.I don’t get it how come this shoe can be this big.

I LOVE THESE. My daughter wanted them, so I went down 2 sizes for Men. Didnt fit at all. Luckily, my youngest son is an 8 1/2 so 9 fit perfectly. Exactly what we ordered. The size seems true to fit, but Id only go 1 size down for a female, not 2 sizes like usual.

This pair of shoes fit my right foot perfectly, but not my left foot. The left shoe was slightly smaller (in width) which cramps up my small toe and actually hurts and caused a blister from rubbing on the wall of the shoe. Nice shoe, but buyers should purchase a little bigger size for comfort.

Was a gift for my husband. Received with shoe lace almost completely torn, contacted the seller and told them of the issue and requested a new pair of laces. They responded and said they would not send a replacement shoe lace and advised us to just return the item.(Careless Customer Service)  So we decided to just keep the shoe because they were super cute and everything else seemed fine and it was just a shoe lace issue, but while my husband wore the shoe for only ""1 HOUR"" THE SHOE COMPLETELY OPENED AND SPLIT AT THE CREASE!!?? We have never received shoes of this quality from Nike EVER and that's all we buy for the whole family. I would wait to share your review until AFTER you wear the shoe instead of how cute they look right out of the box. Quality is trash save your money and purchase from another seller or in store.

These shoes came in a brown box with marker writing on it. The shoes look like they’ve been worn and the sticker on the bottom of the shoe shows they were probably purchased on clearance at Nordstrom Rack. Not worth the price especially when you can purchase the same pair brand new directly from Nike for less money.

Not sure if the product is fake, or the factory just had poor quality control. There is noticeable glue exactly like in the picture, and there was a random indent in the leather like a hot iron was accidentally placed on it. I still like the shoes, I just think it should have cost less.

Upon arrival the box was very damaged. When opened the shoes smelled like feet and did not have brand new shoe smell. Its disgusting that they advertise as brand new and they have signs of being worn in the past.

I’ve only worn these a few times and as you can see in the pictures white glue is coming off the stitches lineage. Nike shoes would never do that in less than 30 days and a few times of use. I’m sorry Amazon but there needs to be product inspecting when retailing big brands like Nike

I love this style shoe and need another pair so I ordered these thinking they were cheaper and a good deal.. it wasn’t quite it unfortunately. On top of it the delivery was delayed when I paid extra for it to come asap. I ended up buying a pair at the store for $50. I would have kept them if there wasn’t a huge flaw.

Honestly these shoes are great, never to expensive,  not to bad to match with your fits. I always saw these like the Air force 1's little brother in comparison lol. But all honesty this shoe in came clean and in perfect condition, right fit and smells new. However I unfortunately will have to admit that I seen on StockX that it shows in October of 2021 someone was able to cop for only $55. How new and the condition it was in, I have no clue? So I guess that's the risk you take buying from certain places. The last asking price on StockX was for $83 and I got these for technically $75 before all the shipping and what not so total was about $105 grand total. Which is fair and close to $101 if you were to purchase on StockX so pretty similar. Again I don't know the quality from other places, so this place is legit and thank you again for the fresh new courts.👍👟😁

These come up very large and are not as comfortable as I was expecting. I buy a lot of Nike trainers and have always bought a size 8. But I would definitely recommend you buy at least one size down than you normally order. They are cheap so maybe that’s why they are not as comfortable. Personally in the future I would pay a bit more and get better.

I had these shoes before so I knew what I was expecting, I love these shoes it's clean and very comfortable but one thing I didn't like about how it came was that if you live far and these shoes don't come in a box it just comes in the Nike box and when I saw the box I thought the shoes were destroyed, but the shoe was fine but had to throw away the Nike box tho. so don't be surprised if your box is messed up the shoes will prob be fine.

I ordered these Nike shoes on August 18th.  I did not open them until last night, November 13, 2022 when I gave them to my grandson as a present.  This is what we found.  The right shoe is in good order.  The left shoe is very dirty as you can see around the inside of the top of the heel. Both shoes show size 9 on the inside label but the left shoe is at least one size smaller than the right shoe.  This is so odd!

I got this shoe over the summer. I really didnt need it right away, I got it just incase if I need a white shoe. So I didn’t try it right away. When I tried later, I found out it was too big. It was also too late for me to return it. I wear size 10 or 10.5 depending on the shoe style and brand. This shoe was very big, I gave nephew who wears size 12 and he even said this is big.I don’t get it how come this shoe can be this big.

I LOVE THESE. My daughter wanted them, so I went down 2 sizes for Men. Didnt fit at all. Luckily, my youngest son is an 8 1/2 so 9 fit perfectly. Exactly what we ordered. The size seems true to fit, but Id only go 1 size down for a female, not 2 sizes like usual.

This pair of shoes fit my right foot perfectly, but not my left foot. The left shoe was slightly smaller (in width) which cramps up my small toe and actually hurts and caused a blister from rubbing on the wall of the shoe. Nice shoe, but buyers should purchase a little bigger size for comfort.

From what I could tell, the shoes felt comfortable...but I ordered 15's...at least I thought I did. Then 14's delivered. I went to return the 14's. When I looked at my order history, it showed that I ordered 14's. Thought it was my mistake. Then I went to order 15's...I selected the size 15 icon and placed the shoe in my cart. When I went to check out, it defaulted back to 14's. VERY FRUSTRATING!

The shoes are a nice deep red color perfect fit and they look good. Now that the pandemic is slowly getting better they will make your feet look good as you step out again.

Bought these for a gentleman that lives in a retirement home and has no family. I noticed he put Nike sneakers on his list. Thought he would enjoy.

Was a gift for my husband. Received with shoe lace almost completely torn, contacted the seller and told them of the issue and requested a new pair of laces. They responded and said they would not send a replacement shoe lace and advised us to just return the item.(Careless Customer Service)  So we decided to just keep the shoe because they were super cute and everything else seemed fine and it was just a shoe lace issue, but while my husband wore the shoe for only ""1 HOUR"" THE SHOE COMPLETELY OPENED AND SPLIT AT THE CREASE!!?? We have never received shoes of this quality from Nike EVER and that's all we buy for the whole family. I would wait to share your review until AFTER you wear the shoe instead of how cute they look right out of the box. Quality is trash save your money and purchase from another seller or in store.

A 12 is normally a little tight on me until broken in w Nikes. Theres like 2 inches of room however in this pair. I don't know if they are a misprint or what. I guess that's what I get for buying shoes on amazon. Dissapointing. They look great... Just wish they fit

These shoes came in a brown box with marker writing on it. The shoes look like they’ve been worn and the sticker on the bottom of the shoe shows they were probably purchased on clearance at Nordstrom Rack.

Not sure if the product is fake, or the factory just had poor quality control. There is noticeable glue exactly like in the picture, and there was a random indent in the leather like a hot iron was accidentally placed on it. I still like the shoes, I just think it should have cost less.

I usually own Nikes, and since this had great reviews and was at a reasonable price, and people were saying it was a consistent fit with other Nike shoes, I thought I'd be safe.  But the shoe at the toes/bone, width-wise, was way too tight - painfully tight for me and I had to remove them immediately.  (The length was fine.)  I cannot remember ever having to buy wide shoes, and these Nikes do not, for me, fit like the other Nike shoes that I've owned at the same size, 11.5.Side note, the side of the shoe - the rubber - are to me, shockingly and unnecessarily bulky and gaudy.  I bought black, thinking it would be less conspicuous, but it's still pretty obvious and a little ugly.  It didn't look bad online, but once I opened them I did a double take.  It's getting harder and harder to find simpler, conservative-looking tennis shoes from Nike that can be worn casually, so I may have to go another route at last.  I realize everyone's taste is different, so maybe it's something you'd like and it's just me.

Over a decade or so, this is my fourth pair of these shoes (Nike Men's Air Monarch Iv Cross Trainer) - that should say it all!  They are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, and I usually wear them all day long, every day.  No need for stinky memory foam inserts that make your feet sweat, these are comfortable right out of the box.  As long as the shape of the shoe is right for you, the arch etc..., then you should find this shoe one of the most comfortable you've ever worn.  I'm an athlete and I also do a lot of outside work building things, these shoes hold up for as long as can be reasonably expected and stay comfortable.
",5,happy

I've been buying the Air Monarchs for 25 years, they lasted at least a year even with running 3 miles 4 or 5 times a week. SUPER COMFORTABLE. My feet were  killing me from wearing steel toes at work, but my feet were revid as soon as I put them on and I was able to run a 5k race..

I really like these shoes (attractive, good fit) for general wear and the heel support is very good (rigid).  The one issue many online users have pointed out for many years is an adhesive problem between rubber sole and leather upper and I, as well, have experienced this although relatively well into the sneakers' expected life.  Nike could benefit from addressing this issue.

I have wide feet and I work 16 hour days on a high-speed passenger ferry.  I am on my feet most of the time and it is a constantly moving platform.  I cannot say these are the Best shoes I have ever owned but like them well enough (bang-for-the-buck) that I have bought 3 pair over the past 2 years. My work environment is tough on shoes. Climbing up and down ladders, in the engine rooms, in the jet rooms, up/down the gangways, etc.  It is ironic that they require us to wear white shoes doing the jobs we do LOL.  Anyway.  Not the best...not the worst.  Definitely good enough that I have bought a replacement pair each time I wear them out.  I have not had a pair ""fail"" on me. The insole/support eventually gives out (I'm a big guy).

i bought these last 10 years ago..these are not as comfortable as the older ones. they are a lil stiffer and rub on my ankle... but not broken in yet.like the looks. also these are a solid piece not mesh. wanna see if nike has fixed the squeaky sole  that these get after being worn for awhile. every pair i have bought.... air monarchs.... start to squeak .. quite loudly after being worn awhile  8 month to a year. every single pair i have gotten.. i will say these do wear very well. last pair was nice and comfy.. hoping  as these break in they will get more comfy..i used to truly like my nikes .. been using asics lately.. real comfortable but  they are a mesh in damp or rain your foot gets wet much quicker than you would in a pair of the monarchs. thought i would try them again as price was right. older i get .. the more i like that cushion in my shoe. nikes run closer to actual size than the asics do. asics run small i wear a 7.5  get a 8 in nike and a 8.5 in asics. time will tell how i like them. not so much now.

I was asked to rate this product, and I gave it 3 Stars. Sure Nike’s are great shoes, blah, blah, blah. All that said, like most shoes made today, they don’t last. Whatever you do, don’t get them wet. Getting them wet speeds up the pace at which they degrade. I can burn through a pair of Nike’s in about 4 months just walking. In the early days of Nike’s, they could last me a year. In those days I was running cross country and track. At the height of my training (in high school) I was doing 14 miles a day. And, I was wearing the same shoes to class. Every year I would purchase a new pair. It is really sad that Nike’s just don’t last.

Went to a distant Nike outlet, had a million Nikes, but only a couple of Monarchs!. Ordered both a regular 12 and the 12 4E from Amazon. The 4Es fit my normally 2E size, maybe a hair wider than necessary, but fine.Only these and basketball shoes have the smooth top I likeThese have the full length air sole and a padded tongue. Very comfortable for me. No stupid four foot long laces either.Mine do not squeak at all.Running shoes generally are smaller and lighter than these. I see these more as everyday and walking shoes. The heel lift is perfect for me.Note that the tread is not deep and so it does not pick up stones to scratch up your floors. That is one of the reasons I bought these. I would like to buy more as this is the best shoe I have purchased in a long time.As a great all-around shoe it is surprising that Nike does not promote these and have more colors and sizes. I do like the black/white/red swoosh combo.

Used them for the gym great for 4.5 months. Now right shoe is squeaking. So now every other step it's,  squeak step squeak step squeak step......... I get alot of looks with these shoes. The look that you get with an old car going down the road dragging the exhaust system.

Drove mine through hell and back, snow, rain, grass, and dirt, lasted a long time for a mailman. They are terrible in mud and on ice, beware, they have no grip especially if you wear them daily. Could use more support to other than that good to go.To save money in trying to find the perfect shoe I may just buy this one again as a summer shoe and get some shoes or boots with grip for the winter and call it a day

I purchased this shoe to compliment the other colors in the Monarch series that I have.  They are the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn and won me over away from the Reebok Walk DMX line as they would always rupture their air bladders in just a few months.These shoes fit my feet very well and don't fatigue them like other shoes have.  I wear the all black version around the office and wish that Nike would make a brown leather version suitable for office wear.  If you've got feet problems and need a supportive comfortable shoe then you should consider getting a pair of these for yourself.Edit:  After a few weeks of use they started squeaking when I walked so I had to remove the insoles and line the glued area with baby powder so make it stop.  This has remained true on every pair I've ever purchased so if you own a pair and they start squeaking when you walk then you will need to apply baby powder to the soles underneath the insoles.

The advertisement shows that the size is 4E as shown in the picture.  What I received was width of size D which are a little snug on my feet.  I wish they would have sent the size shown in the picture but they did not.  The 4E size would score 5 stars in all categories but these are just a bit tight!

For the price, they are pretty good shoes. Granted, I'm used to Walmart specials, and figured it was time to go a tiny bit upscale. They look nice. They do have an odd sort of extension to the outer profile of the tread/foot area, but I figure this is more to help with stability and not roll one's ankle as easily in lateral movement. Slightly unexpected; but not a real issue. I don't know how long they'll last, but I'm wearing these about every 1-2 weeks at work (Friday) rotating with another pair/brand of shoes I bought at the same time, expect to get no less than a year of service out of them. Occasional weekend wear as well, but again, rotating between these and the other pair. They have a shank to the bottom, so the sole is rather stiff, but coming from steel-toe work boots, it's kind of nice having that solid platform for support; mostly noticeable when moving quickly, helps support the foot a bit...

My doctor said that I needed a knee replacement which I refuse to do.  Instead, I have been going to a chiropractor to have my knee adjusted.  After about 12 visits I started feeling better.  I'd long stop wearing dress shoes and opt for black tennis shoes at work.  My first pair was FILA I thought they fitted great.  After several months I knew I needed to replace them. Since I couldn't remember the name I decided to try NIKE, I'd always liked them.  I have some pain still but nowhere near as bad as before the chiropractor adjustment. I'm still going and expect to be pain free soon.  So, I really didn't think shoes would make a difference.  Boy was I wrong the arches in these shoes makes me stand up straight which take the pressure off my knee.  I am walking pain-free (UNBELIABLE).  If  stoop over pain, stand up straight no pain.  I love these shoes.  I want to buy another pair just because I want to use them to start going back on my walks.

Shoes were too tight around the toes. Not wide as described in the add.

My previous pair lasted 4 years. I only stopped wearing them because they were too soiled to clean up. I still wear them for yard work. The new pair... after approx. 4 months the sole separated on the back half of 1 sneaker, then the toe of the same shoe. This design squeaks (everyone knows that). you can put talcum or WD40 to take care of that. But if it's such a known issue why cant Nike fix the design flaw.

My adult son who works at the airport and is on his feet for many hours a day LOVES these shoes.  I talked him in to rotating his work shoes everyday which help him do a better job and get a promotion.  If you work on hard floors and / or work out every day, I urge you to buy two pair of shoes and rotate them. They will wear out after 6 months and then new shoes from Amazon could be ordered up.  He gets three new pair of shoes twice a year and wears em down. He appreciates the new shoes and the price is the lowest here on Amazon.

This is a great shoe.  I've purchased about 4 pairs now, 3 from sports stores the last pair from Amazon.  I wear custom Orthodics and shoe shopping is somewhat of a nightmare for me.  I need a shoe with a deep heel that also has a removable sole.  Not to mention that the shoe has to be wide enough to fit the orthodic AND my wide foot.  This shoe is just AWESOME!!  I can not only remove the sole of the shoe, but once I put in my Orthodics, my foot just slides in.  When the shoe is too narrow, the shoe will squeak like a wet shoe only worse.  It is very annoying and they don't stop making noise even when the shoe is well broken in.  With these, I have no squeaking.  they are very comfortable, last a long time and support my feet.  I'm on my feet most of the day and my back and feet don't hurt as much with these shoes.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who not only has wide feet(like I do) but who also has to wear inserts.  Thanks Nike for providing a wide shoe for those who need it.

These are the noisiest sneakers I’ve ever bought. They make noise walking on carpet! Beware, they also run small.

I rarely give that fifth star, most products I buy have much more to improve and 5 stars seems too perfect for me. But these sneakers are just that, perfect.These are my 7th pair, and I will continue to buy them. I do own other sneakers, but the others are more for fashion and less for function.These are the best fitting sneakers I've ever owned. Not to take away from looks, cause they are nice to look at, but they're considered the low end of Nike, compared to those like Air Max. Even so, they're built tough and can outlast them all. I still have an older pair I use for around the house, and dirtier chores. And the newer ones I use for walking around or being on my feet longer than usual.They come in a great variety of sizes which was my initial interest. I can get these in very extra wide, while still in half sizes like 11.5 4E which is perfect for my wide feet. And they have a good cushioned insole.

My feet are very wide so I bought the extra wide size. I wore them for months with much discomfort thinking they would break in, but they never did. I ended up giving them to a homeless shelter. Great quality and they last forever though- the reason I know this is because I've had the white Monarchs before that finally broke in. I've since switched to Asics. If you have this same problem finding sneakers wide enough, try Asics.

I have had two previous pairs of Air Monarch so I knew what to expect.  The shoe is comfortable, has great support and offers sizes for guys with wide feet.  It's a good looking shoe, great for casual wear--grown up enough without being stodgy!It also holds up better than the current comparable New Balance offerings.  I have flipped between these two companies over the years and the quality seems to change in terms of durability of their respective shoes as years go by.  I have both brands in my closet currently, and as great as New Balance has always been for those of us with Fred Flintstone feet, I think their shoes have become pricey and they fray and tear way too easily (even if you buy a leather shoe from NB the insides seem to tear early).  Nike gets the nod for 2017 in terms of quality and price....As per usual, great delivery speed and price from Amazon.

Nice comfortable shoe. Compared to New Balance shoes the glue holding the soles to the uppers lasted a little longer. Still the reason for buying new shoes is that the sole unglue and start to fall off. With frequent use, NB lasted about 6 months, Nike maybe 8. Dewy morning walks or wet pavement - not splashing through puddles - seems to be what does them in.

Immediately felt that this shoe gives great support coming away from a work shoe that was killing my feet. This shoe gave arch and heel support just putting my foot in it.

There is one issue with this Nike model that I've had with each pair I've purchased. After the first few weeks of reguar wear, the insole / midsole develops a very audible squeaking sound that is apparent with each step. I am not certain how the insole is attached, but it loosens and the rubbing between it and the midsole can get quite loud. Using some talc powder inside the shoe can temporarily quiet the sound, but it eventually comes back even louder.  the only permanent way I've found to deal with this is to remove the insole and place a thin silicone sheet between it and the midsole.  This has been an issue for several years now, and Nike has be made aware of it. I buy this model because it is one of very few that are made in my size. I really wish Nike would put some effort into solving the squeaking once and for all.

Since buying my first pair of Nike Air sneakers, more than 20 years ago, I've not found better sneakers anywhere.  I've had Addidas, Asiacs, and other, but none of them are as good as Nike, and within the spectrum of Nikes, the Monarchs are the best of the best.  A couple of years ago I retired from a very, very physical job requiring miles of walking every day.  When I get home, I'm beat, but my feet feel fine.  I will say that even Nike's wear out, and when they do my legs, and hips start to tell me about it.  A new pair of Monarchs gives me my comfort back immediately.  As long as they are available, I'll be buying them.  I very comfortably recommend Nike Air Monarchs to anyone, especially if you are on your feet all day in your job.

I have been wearing these shoes for years.  I work in a Home Depot store and walk miles on the concrete floors and can tell you, shoes make all the difference in the world and these shoes are the best.  I wear them every day.

This is my second pair of the same shoe, just a different color. I’ll start to rotate them now. They fit just right in the toes, sides, and the heel areas. Also like them because I can keep shoe laces tied and slip them on and off with minimal force. Some people have weak hands with arthritis like me so slip on outdoor shoes are nice to have. Not all Nike shoes will slip on and off easily. Great fit, nice looking, ease of use. 5 Stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ !

I've been wearing this particular shoe model for years now and like them very much for my needs. This particular pair was priced great and comparable with the the cost locally. I've had  a difficult time walking into my local department store or even the shoe stores and finding this shoe in my size... not because it is a odd size but apparently it is a popular size that nobody chooses to overstock to adjust for their demand. Instead they'll look on there store inventory computer to see if any other local branches have them and send you to them or they'll offer to ship a pair to you so, I just cut that out without having to travel to find out if they have a pair or not.

My company recently changed from a business causual to a causal dress code.  I have this same shoe in white, so I decided to purchase the same shoe in black to look a little less tennis shoe-ish at work and not have to change shoes for my lunchtime powerwalking workouts.

Great pair of tennis shoes.  My 21 year old nephew needed a new pair of tennis shoes and asked if I'd buy him a pair.  I picked these out and had them shipped to him.  After receiving the shoes I asked how he liked them and he stated he loved them.  As long as he is happy I'm happy.  So far they seem to be handling the rough treatment expected by a young adult.  No issues at all with the shoes or the fit.  I ordered the same exact size he wears in tennis shoes that are purchased in the big box stores.  Great product and loved being able to ship them directly to him which saved me time and money.  Great Product and would buy again.

I want a replacement! I've had this same shoe several years ago and I remembered how well they fit and lasted but this pair of shoes has me embarrassed walking through a store.

These shoes are wonderful shoes. My fiancée is heavyset and is very hard on shoes. He is on his feet all the time, and does outdoor work. They support his feet well, and he doesn’t have leg or back pain when he wears them. (Unlike his Walmart brand shoes.) Also they last him about a year of heavy use. The only downside is the rubber comes away from the body of the shoe at the front over time. Somehow he does this to all of his shoes no matter what. Still I am impressed with these.

These are good, durable shoes but not as breathable as I'd like.I see lots of other dads wearing these shoes, so they must be popular.  The best feature of these shoes are that kids tend to make fun of them which only fuels my paternal pride.  Common remarks from adolescents are directed towards their 1980's styling.  As long as you're not single or fashionable, and very comfortable with the dad look, these shoes are for you.Don't forget to purchase cargo shorts and 1980's/90's reference graphic t-shirts to complete the look.

I have a wide foot and these sneakers in the 4E width are the most comfortable I've found.  I usually try to by them at our local Kohl's store when they are on sale, but I had some Amazon gift cards that covered the cost of buying these through Amazon.  These fit me perfect (ordered a size 10 4E which is my correct size).  I have tried Sketchers, New Balance and these Nike sneakers and the Nike to me has the best support and the longest lasting support of the three brands.  The Amazon seller shipped these out to me right away and there were no issues with the sneakers or the delivery.Changing my review after having these sneakers for a little while.

I've been buying these shoes for years. I usually go through a couple pair in about a year to 16 months. I usually keep my older pair for mowing grass, working around the yard and garage etc and keep the newer pair for going out shopping, ballgames, restaurants, just about all the other times when I don't need dress shoes. I am a big guy and wear big 4E shoes and these are very comfortable. I usually keep a ""new"" pair in the box ready for when I decide my ""old"" shoes are ready for the trash and convert the ""good"" ones to the ""old"" ones and get out the ""new"" pair to be the ""good"" ones.

Wonderful shoes for everyday wear or exercise. I use them as my everyday shoes. They are sturdy, comfortable and planted/stable. I need to use 4E size, I roll out when I walk. so I need shoes that provide extra support. I did my research, there are barely any shoes on the market for this price and comfort level.As someone else had mentioned here, these shoes tend to squeak after some time. It can be easily fixed with talc powder. Just take out foam inserts, spread some talc over the bottom inside and put inserts back where they were. It fixed all squeaking for me and now these shoes are just perfect.Minor issues: blue bottom tends to color white parts on the other shoe where they touch.

I got these because I was tired of Adidas and liked the look.  I have the white/black/red, not the weird looking all black in the picture.  I knew about the squeaking issue, but seemed to be an easy fix.  I tried them on at a local store before ordering from Amazon.  I would have just bought them at the local store, but they were out of my size.  Anyway, these, to me, run a bit small.  I wear 11.5 in almost every brand, but usually need a 12 in Nikes.  These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned, and that includes my current workshoes (Merrill Shiver Moc), which cost well over $100 usually.  Time will tell on the wear and squeak, but after a few days with some heavy walking mixed in, these are great!

Without a doubt these are the most comfortable sneakers I've ever worn. Not only that but they simply don't wear out. I only replace them when they get dirty and marked up to the point they can no longer be cleaned.  At that point they become work shoes for the yard and garden.

I have been wearing these sneakers for years. Good quality and comfortable. Just recently learned how to stop the squeak when you walk. Talcum powder under the insert. Thanks you tube. ordered a  pair even though I didn't need them yet, to avoid the new tariff. You know how it goes the price will go up and never come back down even if the tariffs are removed. I.E. the gas price increase. Gas came down and prices did not follow, of course. Wear almost everyday.

These shoes are very comfortable.  This is my third pair - they last about two years of daily wear.  There are many reviews that complain that these shoes squeak rather loudly.  They do, but I found the cure - 1) remove the inner sole 2) coat the inside of the sole of the shoe with Neatsfoot Oil 3) put the inner sole back in - no more squeaks.  They would definitely be a 5 star if not for the squeak.

I got these for a friend. He's a big guy about 350 pounds and a size 15 4E. I personally like this specific shoes so I got some for him to try out.

These were for my husband for work. Sturdy shoes for the money. Unless his feet grew at 60yrs old, they seem to run a tad narrow (he got 4E).Beware: NOT SLIP RESISTANT! Of course they only claim “traction on varied surfaces”, so....

So happy with these, especially in the 4E width - WHAT a difference for me!  I put inserts in these for my plantar fasciitis, and these are the most comfortable shoes I have ever had.  My only issue is they go sour pretty fast - which was never an issue for me till the last couple of years, so I don't know if it's the materials in this shoe, or if my body chemistry is changing.

I have owned two other NIKE Men's Air Monarch IV Cross Trainer's. The last pair I had lasted 6 years without tearing, coming apart or and other failures. I had minimal wearing down on the bottom sole which, was expected after all the use I put them through. I still wear the old pair for dirty jobs and such. I decided to buy another new pair and it fit exactly as the others. Perfectly. I have always ordered a 10 4E. With my ""Square toes"" they fit great. Fantastic shoes.

Comfortable well made shoes with great quality leather tops. Unfortunately the sole on the right shoe was defective and significantly higher than the other and they were returned.Buying shoes on the net can be problematic but I've found over the years that Nike is always true to size and style tends not to deviate from their standard sizing. I wear 10.5 but ordered these in a 10 because I wanted them snug.But even at a half size down they were 'boxy"" an the fit was loose in all the wrong places i.e.: arch support, Heel and toe. My guess  is that this has more to do with the molding problems that shoes had than Nike producing a shoe inherently sized to large.In fact based on the glowing reviews here, I would say that's not the case at all.Hopefully my next pair will be free of damage and I'll be ordering a half size down just to be on the safe side.

Bought these Nike brand as they looked very similar to a pair I had from New Balance and lasted for over 5 years and was about to buy again when I saw the advertisement for these. So, thinking, hey Nike for about the same price, big name, probably better, right? Wrong... they don't feel as comfortable as the NB, as they are slightly different in the design, mainly in the heel, as can be seen in the side by side comparison in the pictures attached of the left shoe of my 5 year old NB and the new Nike. I kept them anyway and still giving three stars as they aren't too bad, but wishing I would of bought the NB brand again.

I have been wearing Nike Air Monarch shoes since they were first introduced. This is generation four and I am glad that the sole pattern has been changed. Generation 3 was squeaky after some wear on the bottom. Otherwise, the fit and comfort are as the have always been. I am on my feet for up to 14-15 hrs a day when I work and these have been the best shoes I have found for my type of work and since they are all black, they pass as dress shoes even in a suit when a suit is required

Perfect fit for my husband he absolutely loves these shoes. I strongly recommend them for anyone who wants quality tennis shoes that are proven to stay comfortable even after prolonged use.

Picky husband says these are very, very comfortable.  Order a half-size larger and a width wider than the size you normally wear.  That is typical for Nike athletic shoes across the board.  He wears an EE in width and a shoe size of 11.5. I order a 12, EEEE and they fit him comfortably. The photo has the Nike 12 EEEE next to his Propet 11.5 EE snow boots.

The shoes themselves are decent. I have owned two previous pairs, one in black, one in white. They both have developed an annoying squeaking/scrunching sound. I thought there was something going on with the shoes and bought another pair. This pair does the same thing. There is something in the way the shoe is made that when a heavier person walks it scrunches and makes noise - even on sidewalks of thin carpeting.

These are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. I have had severe plantar fasciitis for years. I have tried splint boots, stretching exercises, steroid shots and custom orthotics. Nothing helped. On the advice of a co-worker, I tried these shoes. After wearing them at work every day for about three months, my pain starting improving. After six months I had no symptoms or pain. I stopped all of the other treatments and have been pain free for over two years!! I have replaced these a couple of times because like any other shoe, they are going to wear out. If you have plantar fasciitis or arch problems, you need to try these shoes!

These shoes are rather heavy, but are reasonably comfortable. The rear portion of the heels wear down fairly soon with my stride.

These are incredible. A very sturdy shoe. I wear to walk on breaks and lunch at work, so the all black was a must. They are a little bulky, but that speaks to their support. As someone overweight I can walk much farther with less knee and foot pain with great supportive shoes like these. Size 13W

This shoe is very comfortable. It has a very thick sole with lots of padding, and I'm thinking the Nike air sole really does deserve it's hype and popularity.

I find this to be a great sneaker and I've been buying them for years. An oddity of this sneaker is the 'soul squeak' which is consistent and pretty much there for the life of the shoe.

It's a shame Nike can't fix this one flaw because this really is a great shoe.

One of the shoes squeak really bad.  After examining, one shoe on bottom had rubber not seated correctly.  Wish there was better quality control for Nike shoe that's not cheap.  One shoe is great and I hate the other.  Don't even wear much, probably for cutting grass now unfortunately.

Due to a foot issue this is the only brand and model of shoe my husband wears.  The cushion is soft enough to not cause pain to the plantar's wart, but not so soft as to allow his foot to hit the bottom of the sole like memory foam does.

I work in as a primary care provider and am on my feet constantly. These provide the cushion I need and are ""neat"" enough to wear with slacks and a button-down shirt. A little bulky feeling and the fit is on the large size, but overall I'm pleased with these.
",4,happy

To fix the squeak, I simply removed the insole and put it again. I didn't even put any kind of powder, like others people recommended. What cause the squeak (I think) is just the glue used to attach the insole to the tennis.I bought this tennis in 2012 and still use it almost everyday. I even used it once to play tennis on a clay surface. It's  very impressive the durability and comfort of it. I would give it 10 stars if I could.

Reasonably comfortable but you know when you get a new pair of shoes and they break in and get more comfortable, I don't think this is going to happen. Whatever the plastic is they make these shoes with has very little ""give"". I think these things are going to stay pretty rigid for the life of the shoe.

I have a very wide foot and arthritic joints.  These shoes have a very wide fit in the EEEE size, extra room for my feet and plenty of padding.  I was pleased to find this shoe in white leather since Nike currently makes mostly dark nylon colors in this style.  I wanted white leather.  This is a very comfortable shoe and looks good enough to wear most places that I go.  Will buy again as long as I can find the white leather.

Are usually buy Reeboks for these type of marathon running shoes but they’re no longer available so I thought I would try the Nike version.  These are a excellent replacement I love the shoe.

I buy a pair of these every 5-8 weeks for the last 4 years. This is the first pair to actually break. I guess the glue gave out on the sole.

came with a stain (probably some sort of glue from manufacture)  on top of toe area, makes me wanna think this pair was soldas a seconds, and i paid full price. since it was cosmetic and these shoes were purchased for walking, i didnt complain since the comfort and other aspects were spot on!

Overall I liked the shoes.  They hold up well, but they do run just a tad small.  I'd say order the next half size up of what you might normally get.  Normally I buy Reebok, however this time around I bough Nike.  Maybe if youre a Nike fan you already know exactly what size to get, but if you're not, a half size up is the way to go.

Love these, perfect for a 4E in need of adequate arch support. Even better for the arch and fit are the Pegasus 4Es, and the number 3 in my experience are the GT 1000s by Aisics... rounding out the bottom are the newbalance runners and trainers... The toe in those might cause face plants and they are basically flat soled... lol. I can't say anything beats a Nike, they've earned their name!

My husband has worn Nike Air Monarch shoes for years. They provide the fit and comfort that he likes.  He recently went to the store to get a new pair but they didn't have his size so I found them on Amazon for him.  He received the new? pair yesterday.  When he took them out of the wrapping, the box said it was a size larger than what he wears but when he looked at the shoes, they were the right size.  Also the shoes look like they may have been worn. They don't look quite new, the bottoms look like they've been walked on.  I wanted to return them but he said he wanted to keep them because he has a trip in a few days that he wanted them for, so I'm settling by writing a less than perfect review.  Buyer beware.

Great Sneaker! I've always worn New Balance, but I have been disapointed that they dis-continued the V3's, and the V4's are just not the same?

I had given up on wearing comfortable walking shoes, but these Nike Air Monarchs are comfortable and fit great with my 4E size foot.

Put these puppies on and felt sweet on my feet. Considering the thickness of the soles shoes were light. First day out walked along concrete city for 5 hours and feet didn't hurt or feel tired.

Seemed like a knock off.  Been wearing this same model for years but these were just not right. To tight on my toes on one foot like they were not sewn correctly. Other shoe seemed fine.

I've been wearing this model sneaker for a few years now. This is my first pair, and within the first week or two, that haven't held up. The inside cushioning is already worn down. Almost like a hole has formed underneath the pad, underneath my big toe.  Feels like my old pair that I've worn for a year. However, the outside is fine. I have a feeling this sneaker is from one of the first releases where the shoe squeaked. You're better off going to a store and trying it on.

I love Nike Monarchs, and never had an issue in the past buying them from department stores. Within 1 month of wearing these specific one from Amazon, the right foot developed a faint squeak with each step, and it has since become so loud that I rarely wear these shoes. Perhaps poor quality control with inner components of the shoe becoming unglued? As a Nurse, I cannot walk down the unit and sound like a squeaky toy with every step, as the one time I wore them, several colleagues mentioned it. I am not suggesting that the brand/style should be avoided, rather that Amazon is not the place you should be buying these (as many other reviews have stated).

I have owned three pair if these shoes and every time I purchase another brand I keep coming back. I have a wide foot and these shoes fit me great. And even though I have read reviews that talk about squeaking I have not had this problem. But it seems like an easy fix if I do.

I've decided to change my rating on these shoes, I had previously rated them 5 stars, the fit is wonderful, very comfortable, but the last few pairs I have purchased have started squeaking a few months after purchase.  Maybe just a bad run from the manufacturer but I'm not sure if I will purchase again.  Two pairs now have done this.  It makes them kind of embarrassing to wear, they squeak very loudly.  So down to 3 stars.Update - I decided to see if they (Nike) had fixed the squeak problem with these shoes and purchased a pair in a store. About 3 months in the squeak showed up.  I know there are home remedy fixes for this but I have given up on Nike.  I used to trust this brand but no more.

I bought several pairs of this model shoe, both in black and white, and all white.  I thought it was just me and my particular walking habits that caused the toe guard on the left shoe to come apart.  Then, when I was getting ready to buy yet another pair after the toe guard recently came apart, I read a few of the negative reviews.  I discovered IT""S NOT ME!  Other people have suffered this problem.  I think Nike should either refund our money or send us a pair of free replacement shoes.  I like these shoes.  I must, I bought 5 pairs of them.  But I doubt if I would ever buy another pair of Nikes as long as they are selling defective shoes.

I really have liked this shoe, but its one downfall is that after a while they start to squeak.  Its annoying as hell.  I have dealt with it as I get a decent life out of shoe before it starts.  This pair started squeaking after one week.  I can't tolerate it and refuse to buy another pair so soon.  Guess I am done with Nike.

The sneakers look great, but the ""air soles"" do a lot of squeaking when walking.

This isn't about the seller as the seller shipped quickly and product was as described. This is about the Nike Monarch shoes. I won't ever buy a pair of Nike's shoes again. Squeaking only took two months of steady wearing to begin. Comfortable yes but that's it. Maybe if I was a buck fourty they wouldn't squeak but I wouldn't count on it.  Never again. New Balance or Addias from now on. You've been warned.

I have issues with feet and over the last decade I've found only this style allows me to walk around all day and not be very soar at night.  So I love them for that reason, however something has changed in the last couple years where now the material and/or construction are such that it's almost embarrassing to wear these in public.  Heck even around my house!  I'm constantly apologizing for how loud they are and it sucks!  Next pair I'm going back to my local store and buying to see if maybe it's the source Amazon is buying from.  Who knows.

I liked finding what I thought was a quality shoe in wide size.  I dislike the discoloration appearing on the front top side of one shoe within the first week, and the squeaking that one of the shoes developed on the third day of use.  The purpose for buying these was for normal daily use/walking.  They are an embarrassment when wearing in public places due to the noise they emit with every step of my left foot. I wasted almost 50.00 and am highly upset. NO MORE NIKE FOR ME,EVER!

This is my fifth pair of Air Monarch IVs. The first four pairs were size 9 all white in color whereas this pair I ordered in white/cool grey/anthracite. (The last all white pair I purchased are still in use, that's how much I like them.) The first two pairs were purchased at a local sporting goods store, the second two pairs I ordered from Amazon. The first four (all white) pairs fit great were comfortable, durable and I wore them often. This last pair was ordered in the same size as the previous four pair only this pair doesn't fit as comfortably as those before. Much to tight.

Update on shoe wear:I have had these shoes for about two months and they are starting to squeak when I walk. This is the second pair of Nike Air Monarchs I have had and both pair did this.

Sadly, I have bought them for a LONG time but they started squeaking after a month and I did the thing with ripping out the cushion support piece and sprinkling baby powder in it and that works by the way and putting it back on. It is sad that a LARGE company can't fix the problem. Maybe training class for it's workforce might help or a knowlegeable person to FIX it.  I won't buy them again. It's sad because they are indeed comfortable.

these are great shoes and all, but you can tell they have either been used or are not the original nike. they have a few marks and what looks to be hot glue strings on a few of the nike tics. I would just buy from the nike app but hey you get what you pay for, it isnt like they are bad shoes or bad quality shoes they just seem a little bit different from the original.

I worked for Nike from 1987-92 and got 4-5 free pair a month. So I’ve worn a great deal of Nike sneakers. The last few years they’ve become too tight to wear. My son got these and I loved the look so ordered them.Sliding them on is a bitch, once I get them on my feet get sore and I need to slide them off. It’s my fault for not returning them asap. I figured they’d stretch enough to be comfortable.

The shoes appear to be new and good,  but the box was damaged with a hole through  the top and a rubber band around it holding it together. Not a good look for the price and supposedly new Nikes

After reading a lot, I bought my first pair of these shoes because I HAD heel spurs, and I wrote I HAD (all capital letters) because without medicines, doctor’s visit and/or any surgery, the heel spurs is totally gone.I have 4 pairs of these in different colors, my feet are completely healed and I’m super happy to given them a chance.

I was pretty disappointed after paying $170 for these shoes. The foot opening was small and hard to fit my foot in. The shoes were narrow and pretty tight, for the correct size. What I was disappointed in most however was the overall poor quality. There were frayed stitching and no arch support or cushioning anywhere on this shoe. The shoes are cosmetically attractive; however, charging $170 for something that feels like it will last a month or more is just plain awful.
",1,sad

When I took them out of the box it looks as if they were used. Dirty on the white parts and feel cheap. Idk if they are fake or not but seem a lot cheaper then the real pair I have.

These sneakers are super comfortable. If you are an air max fan like me, you will not be disappointed. I usually buy padding inserts for my sneakers for extra comfort but it was not needed for these. I have had these for about 2 years and the comfort remains the same. I really want to give it 5 stars but after about a year of use I began getting tears in the front mesh part of the sneaker. However, in the sneaker's defense, I got them while 7 months pregnant with swollen and already wide feet and I wore them daily throughout and after giving birth. These are definitely a go to sneaker that matches everything. I would buy them again.

Not long after purchasing these, a whole formed in the toe box. Not just this pair but three pairs. Nike should be ashamed to put their name on this, but then again they put their name on Colin Kaepernick.Switched to Adidas’s Ultraboost, much more comfortable.

The shoes last maybe 3/4 months. I would not recommend to any athlete or anyone that exercises daily.

So I originally left a one star review because when I compared these to my originals they were different. Different labels, different sole, slight different printing.I gave them a chance to respond and not until 6 days later did they ask why I thought they were fake. Just kept telling me how long they had been in business.Had the trainers validated by Nike today in store but gives the high profile nature of why these trainers were changed them I’d expect a more informed staff.

My son wanted these shoes for Christmas. He said they are good weight lifting shoes because of the flat bottom. They are difficult to put on since they are high tops. If you have a teen with low muscle tone and fine motor skills I reccomend the low tops. The shoes are well made and sturdy.

I would buy theses shoes again. I like the look, but there was one thing that seemed off. The ""tongue"" (the center part that the laces go over) is not fully covered with material at the top and side edges. The yellow foam is clearly visible and would appear that it will fray with time. Also, the foam showing appears extremely cheap. So much so that at first I wondered if these shoes were fake Nike. I went back to the shoe picture and--nope---the yellow foam is clearly visible in the picture--they just did not provide a very good angled picture to show just how bad it was. I will probably ask my wife to sew white material around the edges to make it look better and hopefully keep it from fraying. Other than that the shoes are awesome...

Shoes were fine when they got here. Box was completely destroyed though. I don’t know enough about shoes to tell if they’re real or not, but they look good enough for me.

These are great-looking shoes that throw back to a simpler time for Nike before its massive endorsement deals. The shoes look great but run snug and can take a while to break them in making them a little hard to put on right out of the box. The shoes also have a thin sole which is great from the profile but not for your feet. Size up and buy some replacement insoles.

Well… the shoes took more then a week to arrive. Came in a nike shoe box well packed. But as u can see on the pictures, I don’t think it’s suppose to have the bare foam exposed like this in a original nike shoes! Makes no sense to me. To be honest, u can’t notice the bare foam on the seller’s pictures page. So, I am not sure if this is original! I don’t think so. But I will paint the foam black and I guess it will be ok. But be aware that the shoes will come like in the pictures.

I’ve never owned a more uncomfortable pair of sneakers. I wish I had read about how difficult they are to break in before purchasing. I’ve worn them at least 10 times and they still rub the back of my legs and heels even with thick socks (which I purchased especially for these shoes). If you are one for fashion over function, then these are the shoes for you!

I have these in two colors - the white with black and the white with green.  No complaints any more though these are uncomfortable at first and require a week or so of breaking them in.  Size is fine - but felt small initially.The black on white crease more than the green on white.  Doesn’t bother me too much but the green has a different texture than the black…and the texture seems to matter when it comes to creases.

I normally don’t write reviews but I had to with this purchase. Calling all overly analytical people or hesitant online shoppers! Hopefully this review helps you whether you are buying these for yourself or as a gift.I got the black version. The sneaker quality is fantastic. It’s not flimsy but it is comfortable and very lightweight. Silver trim is made of perfect. I’m a 10.5 in tennis/athletic sneakers. These fit like a sneakers - not to narrow and length-wise they run larger size if you want. From heel to the tip of my big toe is about 10.5 inches long for reference. So if you know your Adidas or Puma or similar athletic shoe size, I would go down either a half size or a full size.

I got my first pair of these from a local shoe store a few years ago and really liked the comfort and fit.  After a couple of years of walking on pavement the sole began to wear so I started looking for replacement pair and discovered the exact model had been discontinued by Nike but they still had a few pairs for direct mail order so I got another pair.And now more than one year from the second pair I decided I needed a backup and I found these on Amazon.  The price was a little higher than the second pair but I decided I liked them so much I would get a backup pair.They arrived from the seller in a Nike box and obviously new and and perfect shape.  The are a duplicate of the previous shoes I have purchased but the supplier said this was their last pair.I guess I will probably have to find a new model for the next pair.

i have been wearing nike air max's for a long time.  i am an avid runner that loves the tailwind for such or the straight air max.  i was hoping these would be more like the old air max triax for walking.  they are not.normally nike is the perfect shoe for my foot.  these run 1/2 size small and the toebox is very tight at that.  i cannot tell if it is just the 1/2 size but it felt tight on that.  further, the shoe itself was a tad to the narrow side.  most of that is probably due to the added cushioning for these shoes but i am not sure.  now, i believe if you unlace it and walk around with it for a week or so like that it will stretch as the cushioning breaks in but that is not what i want.  i THINK they can be broken in if you get 1/2 size larger than usual but to me it is not worth it.otherwise, very good shoe...showed a lot of potential.

I’d bought the model after this and enjoyed them until they had holes in the mesh. I went to the store to find out that they had newer models so I purchased them thinking they would fit just as good. But they didn’t, this model provides the classic arch support while also having a stylish Nike logo.The only downside is that you might have trouble fitting in your true size, order a half size up if you have big toes. Also look for a possible defect on the inside of the shoe near the tip to make sure it doesn’t bruise.Overall a 9/10.

Burned by Nike yet again! Ya think I would have learned by now! This is the third pair of Nikes I've ever bought and they always fall apart fast. This pair is coming undone remarkably fast! The design is great, they fit perfectly and they're extremely comfortable, this is where 2 stars comes into play. The fact that they're already falling apart is also why they get 2 stars. I haven't even run in them, only walking or riding a bike. I've had them for all of a week! For the price it's kinda outrageous.

Nike Sizing Info:Ladies, if you want to wear this shoe...I'm a 9 in Women's Nike which is equal to 26cm. This shoe's Men's size equalling 26cm is an 8. If you have your favorite perfect fitting Nike shoe, they print the size on centimeters on the tag under the tongue of the shoe.I like the color styling for the men's version of this shoe better than the dull black looking women's version. Also...this shoe is currently $70 at Academy sports website and their sizes are all available. Finding this shoe in my size on Amazon has been a butt pain. They're wider than the usual Nike design which is exactly what I need.I received the shoes from this merchant in a semi-beat up Nike shoe box held together with a giant rubberband but the quality of the shoe was perfect. I just had to return due me getting the size wrong.

I was worried that these would be knockoff fake nikes. However I already have a pair of these and I compared every aspect of them. If they are fakes then they used every material and stitch that nike uses. These look legit. My last pair has lasted me a year and a half and are still going strong. I bought these because I know how they fit already and because the new nike designs aren’t my style.

My last Air Nike shoes which I had purchased, fell apart within two days of use.  Well, the bubbles on the bottom popped and then afterwards, the soles detached.  So I was a little worried about these shoes and put them to even heavier use than the previous ones to see what would happen, and they stood up to the wear and tear. They were initially a little tight at first, but after some use, they fit my feet just fine and did not fall apart at all. I'm glad to wear these comfortable shoes for the long-term future.

So hard to find a professional looking sport shoe I can wear to an office.  I like this shoe because unlike most shoes found in department stores it isn't so flashy.. and usually first thing I do is replace the insole with a professional gel insert... but the ones in these at least at first are great!  If you want a comfortable shoe that isn't so flashy but still looks good.. This is it!

The shoes themselves are very good. The sizes are awful (hence the 3 stars). I checked the size to another nike shoes that I had and fit right, so I ordered that size. It did not fit at all, so I had to return the first one and go 2 sizes bigger. Even after that, they are a bit tight. It is really hard to figure out which to order.These have a thicker build to them, and the sizing seemed to be measured on the outside. So the inside of the shoe is smaller and won't fit right.If the shoe fits though, it's comfortable and looks nice, so I don't feel like I wasted my money.

Dear Seller, I'm completely satisfied, 100%!! Don't worry!! I've had a very pleasant buying experience with you! Shoes have high quality and pretty design, so that, I like it a lot!

Fast shipping. Shoe look like floor model; one worn and one not. Very wide. Too wide. Tried to send back but UPS didnt pick up; then they refused the label and wanted to charge me so I went home and tried to get a new one. It generated the same old ticket. Wrote to Amazon but no reply > guess big bucks doesn't have time for those who put bread on his table.

The Air Max Torch 3 is the Hummer of athletic shoes: it looks large and imposing on the outside, but is tiny and cramped on the inside.  I don't know how shoes that look this wide could be so narrow on the inside.  The toe box is also tight, and the length of the shoes runs one-half to a full size too small.  The shoes I was sent appeared to have used, or at least taken out of the box, before--the shoe box looked like it had been mauled by a cat, see attached picture.  Unless you are looking for used shoes that are chunky and painful to wear, look elsewhere.  I will try to wear them, but only because I wasted 90 dollars on them.

I wear a 9.5 in every other Nike bball shoe (Jordan's and Kobe's) so that is what I ordered. I recommend ordering a half-size larger due to the fore foot being narrow. The sole is stiff, but tougher than my Jordan's and Kobe's which makes them last longer if you plan on using them on a street court. The shoe is lightweight and comfortable, remember to order a half-size larger than what you normally wear in Nike. Highly recommended for outdoor play.

These shoes took forever to arrive and when they finally did, the condition was disappointing. The box was very beat up, the paper inside was ripped and the shoes looked as if they had been tried on by bigfoot a few times. The shoes were very wide, very stretched, and did not look new at all. I was embarrassed to give these as the birthday gift they were ordered for, but they did not fit anyway. I returned them. FYI, I had  to pay postage to return them, and a 25 dollar restocking fee.

My husband loves these shoes!! He is an avid exerciser and has worn this shoe style for several years. He was thrilled to find it on Amazon as it's no longer on Nike's website.

Surprised my boyfriend with these. He was too stubborn to buy new tennis shoes and he really liked them so I figured why not replace them with the same shoes brand new :)

Bought for husband, and he really likes them. He's a fan of the cushion insoles and I like the way they look.

Though all details imply a good show, it was just too small for me.  And I have other Nike's so would think the sizes run similar but not even close.  Much too small.
",3,happy

Tried them on and walked around the living room. Very stiff and uncomfortable. Knew they weren’t for me.  Ended up going to a local DSW and trying on a pair of ASICS that felt  comfortable immediately so I got those .  I liked the look of the Nikes better but I had to go for comfort because that is the main deal Right? ...Not what some celebrity wears . I have What would be considered a small narrow foot and they were still too tight and cramped feeling.

It fits tight at first but is super comfortable after you break them in, is the perfect fit for running shoes. I love it, the most comfortable running shoes I have ever owened.

Fit is just a little bit tighter than my usual 10 1/2.But it's workable. I just needed to break them in. It looks great and provides excellent support.

Shoes hurt my feet after about 20 mins of wear. The arch support feels stiff which cramps and and irritates your feet. Waste of money. Looks elsewhere

Out of the box the shoes looked great, but once on my feet, the truth was painfully clear. The sneaker was too narrow for my foot, and I wasn't going to force it. I'm so disappointed!

Product was clearly used when it arrived the shoes had visible wear mainly on the bottom dirt and sand also hair was present this was disappointing as these weren’t marked as used on the product description.Also these shoes fit tight they aren’t true to size, shoe is a bit narrow be aware if ordering from this company that you have a risk of receiving someones used shoes.

Length and width are as expected for Nike, but fit is unusually tight on the topside of the foot where the shoe's tongue starts, and the laces widen towards the top. Seller says it can't be stretched to fit, but has offered to refund or replace if not worn outside.  It's possible that these shoes will break in with use, but it would be a painful process.

The shoes I ordered were the same number as my previous pegasus 33 (9.5 US) but were large for me. I honestly think that the quality was not  as good as the old Pegassus, because the soles seemed to be hard, almost plastic instead of the softer rubber as the Pegassus.

it appeared to me that these particular shoes have ""made the rounds"" so to speak.  box was damaged, and I would bet good money that more than one person has returned this particular pair of shoes.

I have been wearing this shoe for last six months and liked the shoe and decided to order another pair.  I believe these are all defect shoes on Amazon for this brand and style.  There is a nub that sticks out inside the shoe. It is right next to your big toe and it is EXTREMELY irritating.

I have been buying the Nike downshifters for years and have loved them.  They are cushioned and flexible and great for my sensitive feet.  I decided to try the tourch 3, and have had issues with feet from the start.  They provide cushion, but they are not flexible.  Obviously everyone’s feet are different, but if you buy these and they don’t feel quite right, ditch them immediately or make sure you get your ice packs ready.

I'll keep things short.- Way too bouncy to be a running shoe. Yeah I know, Kipchoge wears them. I don't have his technique and neither does anyone reading this. You will f up your knees doing long distance with these.- Weak frame / poor lateral stability make it a no go for moderately technical trail running- They're comfy enough for commuting, which is what I'll end up using them for. 1 star for the kink in the back, which prevents my longer jeans from touching the ground.

Great shoe to run in, I'm usually 9 or 10 in trainers (brand dependent) so 9.5 fit perfect (side note if ever get Hokas they fit small, I'd suggest going at all least 1/2 a size up in them) but back to Nike Pegasus 39 they're brill (I had Pegasus 36 before these a while back) and my feet have adapted great to these 39s, great price, colour & design.

Foot bed is close to correct size (maybe a little small), but shoes are very much too narrow or otherwise improperly sized sideways and bind feet (though marked as a normal size 11, Not ""narrow""). First time ever (in decades) a Nike running shoe has had this problem. Have consistently returned to Nike BECAUSE they use a relatively narrow last, which fits my feet, but this is abnormally narrow. Are these just very old stock, or mis-manufactured, or maybe knock-offs ? They do look ever so slightly ""off"" from familiar normal Nike production appearance. Seems like a very old design -- though Exactly what I wanted -- which Nike apparently no longer makes (and has not for a very long time). Not clear where they come from, and they are annoyingly snug, which is puzzling, but they are mostly wearable just moderately uncomfortable since too snug. This color not available in larger sizes.

Shoes look great 100% 90's. However one of them came with a crease,and box was damaged. Amazon works don't care when delivering shoes. I've bought 8 pairs of shoes off Amazon and every pair, expect my steal toe boots had a crease and box was bad.

"
I like the shoe a bit, its kind of  slim for a 9.5. It’s comfortable and not too heavy on the foot. Not as comfy as my AF1s but for a Nike shoe under $100 , not bad. A lil disappointed in the boxing but I read the reviews and it seems everyone has poor packaging. Don’t know if its the seller or Amazon workers not taking care of the boxes. Either way, I hope they fix it.

Not very comfortable. Should have a better insole...Sent them back

I like the style of the sneakers easy to wipe off. I wear them for work  I'm on my feet and on the go all the time. I was a disappointed that they were not as comfortable as I expected.  Thinking about getting some inserts.  The price was reasonable.  I might purchase another pair.

It fits, but the durability is something only time can tellBut I'm confused on why it uses the terms ""women 2"" and ""men's court"" when it's a unisex pair of shoes(brand) lol I almost thought I ordered the wrong thing because of that

These are fake knock offs. Ordered a pair and noticed my son wearing them and you can see how it’s uneven in the back. No problem. I ordered a replacement pair and they just showed up the same way, but with stains and glue on them on top of the uneven swish. You can tell someone clearly wore them for a while then sent them back. Box is all ripped up too. Lame

One old, obviously worn shoe was sent with one new shoe. Additionally, the shoes were 2 different sizes.When opening the box the old, worn shoe was covered by tissue paper hiding the fact that it was older.Very disappointing when my son opened the box and looked at the shoes on Christmas.Inspect your package very carefully when receiving.

I had a vintage pair of Nikes from 2007 that finally gave out so I thought I'd buy another similar pair. Sure they are lightweight but, that is because Nike has skimped on material. The soles on my other Nikes had a very grippy sole built for basketball courts. These shoes have a cheaper, harder plastic sole. The leather is thinner and cheaper. Not very cushioned either. I learned my lesson about buying in-store where you can check for quality before shelling out the cash.
",3,sad

Shoes are ok but I’m not sure if they’re legit. Noticed off the back that there was no tissue paper in box with shoes. Very suspicious.

I bought these for my 16 year old son and he really likes how they look but he said they're a bit tight on the sides. They're size 10.5, which is his usual size, so I'm not sure if the shoes just run narrow or what.Also, I had the same issue with poor packaging and other reviewers. The shoes weren't damaged at all but the box was in poor condition when I received it.

The box was tattered and ripped. The top/lid was not on the box. Pic shows how I received these shoes.Laces tightly laced up and show somewhat crinkled. It appears these are  return or perhaps worn for a bit.Very dissatisfied. Not a nice gift presentation at all.

The packages came on time and they fit perfectly but the shoes have definitely been worn before. They were nice and clean in some areas but then I found a lot of scuffs like someone wore them one time and decided to sell them. Not cool.

I like the shoe. Fits great, true to size, and feels good wearing all day. But these are the worst laces ever. They always come undone and they're way too long. So, I'm always stepping on them. Even if I were to double knot them. Maybe replace the laces and you have a fine shoe.

I really wanted to get a different Nike shoe.  However, I was pleased with this purchase.  They are comfortable, although I would of preferred more cushion in the inside of the shoe.

My foot measures a size 13.5, which means typically I have to buy shoes that are either too small or too big.  In my experience, Nike shoes run a bit smaller than their stated size (at least compared to other shoe brands), so I bought a size 14 of this shoe and it fits great.The shoe is light and comfortable.  I've used them for many workouts and they are holding up very well.

I made the  mistake of not reading the description of the shoe completely, and going by just the picture alone.  Had I read the description I would have read that the shoes were white in color and not a light gray as they appear in the picture. I didn't try to them on because I plan returning them, but they do look and feel like the style of shoe I'm looking for.  I was able to find the exact style of shoe on Amazon, but in black, and at a much cheaper price.  Will be receiving those on Friday.

All my shoes are pretty much Nikes except my dress up shoes. I saw these and saw the the price was decent and decided to give them a try. They don’t fit like regular Nike shoes. I buy the same shoe size on any Nike shoe and it fits perfect each time. This however did not fit right. Just like another review said, there is something wrong with the heel. It’s narrow and digs in. Even the insert seems appears different too.  Never experienced this before. It’s actually painful. I do like the design of the shoe but for comfort I never been disappointed ever till I purchased this shoe. Something doesn’t seem right about them. They seem a little more narrow too especially for a training shoe. Honestly would not recommend these shoe. I’m not one to give a negative review but I’m just letting other potential buyers be aware, you might be wasting your money.

I needed new shoes desperately so I spent some $$ ($82 to be exact) on some nice, comfortable looking “nikes” but when I got them, they were the wrong color first off. Second, they’re complete knock offs. I compared them to my other pair of nikes and the swoosh, every bit of material is different and low quality. I didn’t expect knockoffs especially ones for $80!! So I returned them immediately and went on nike.com. They had sales on all their footwear so moral of the story, if you want brand name, go to the website 👏🏽

The back of these shoes will dig in to your heel and make you bleed also the inside sole is oddly shaped and never conforms to your feet. Worst shoe I've ever bought. It's as if someone looked at a perfectly good shoe and thought ""how could we make these unwearable and as uncomfortable as possible...I know! Let's make it feel like there is a knife scraping your heel!""

I don’t know where to begin. I ordered the shoes as I have been using Nike for more than 15 years. These shoes for some reason caused some leg muscles too sore due to which I couldn’t walk for more than 3 days! I am now gradually trying them for a few minutes everyday (there is no other option as I have already paid and I assume the return policy doesn’t come into effect if the shoe has been used). Buy at your own risk.

These remind me of the very first pair of Nikes that I got back in 1981 (the ones that I had to beg my mother to pay $35 for). I wouldn't use these for actual running as they seem more for fashion than anything else, but I'm okay with that.

I only use for walking, not any training. Wore them to a ""Fair"" and after about 4 hours had to take them off to let my feet relax and cool down.

A little tight in the beginning but I love the look.  I work outdoors and in Florida in rains heavy at times so I needed a sneaker that would not let my socks all wet.  Mission accomplished!  Very comfortable now after a week of wearing them and the price was reasonable.  The only problem I had was I paid $73 and two days later the price dropped to $54.  An Amazon rep advised me to return them and then reorder which made no sense; they should have just credited me the $20 difference.  Regardless, I am happy with these.

Great value for the price. They feel comfortable and elegant.Size- I ordered US 8 = EU 38.5, but for some reason once sneakers arrived it said size 6. But that's not a problem, since the EU equivalent is still 38.5 and they fit perfectly.

These shoes are very cheaply made and I would find it hard to believe that they are actual Nike's.  The tongue is unfinished and you can see the foam around the edge.  They don't have the signature Nike tag on tongue-which is a dead give away.  A $70 mistake indeed.

I am going to Nursing school and needed a pair of all white sneakers and was looking in shoe department stores all around me and they either did not have plain white sneakers, did not fit right, or were slip-ons (I prefer tie shoes because then your foot is not as apt to slip out of the shoe.). I was also looking for Nike white sneakers because they are the brand that give my feet the most support. The only think that I do not really like is I like squishy, cushion-y soles and these did not have them. But I will just go and buy some soles that give me that. Otherwise, these sneakers are perfect for what I need!!

These shoes are not comfortable, at all. I had to buy GEL inserts for these shoes to work comfortably all day. One would think that being a ""NIKE"" brand that those shoes would be the most comfortable. The main reason why I bought them was for work. Dress code requires a solid black shoes. For a regular shoe, I am surprised how ""wide"" they really are.  On a positive side the traction is good =)  [Nike should make more selections in solid black. I would love to wear my other Nike's to work, but I can't.]  Overall grade for these shoes- ""They are okay.""

It's a nice lightweight shoe  that's pretty rugged.  It fits true to size.  It's not going to win any fashion contests, but it does the job.  The only thing that caused me to ding the rating is that is a little bit too stiff.  I've had the shoe for a few months now and it's still pretty stiff.  I'm going to use this shoe more for a casual work shoe instead of a training shoe.

Very good, comfortable shoe.  But be careful walking on ice or wet floors.  You'll fall on your ass.  I got this because I'm always on my feet at work.  I'm a cna and I work 8+ hours a day and 99% of the time I'm moving around on my feet.

When wearing these for the first time they ARE tough. I had to take them off for a while as the arch hadn't softened, therefore my sole wasn't seating properly and they started giving me ankles pain. For a while a I thought the sizing on this model was different, I got 10 D, but after 1-2 days of use they became softer and now I'm using them all day long.The biggest con is the sole texture. It doesn't have the rubber feeling that'd stick and give some traction, it's in fact quite slippery.

I've worn many pairs of this shoe over the years because it is light and comfortable. It does not wear forever, though, as the leather will crack and the lining in the heel will fray. That's why I give 4 stars, not 5. Since they are fairly cheap, I just buy another pair.

An absolute value!!  It is indeed unfortunate that Nike has discontinued these shoes, as they are cross-training perfection at a very affordable price.  Supportive, durable, breathable, and understated, these shoes are all I could want in a cross-trainer.  It will indeed be a sad day when I have worn-out my last pair.  I only hope Nike will have seen fit to create something of equal (or better) value.

Felt great like always. I keep going back any buying these shoes for my everyday shoes and will keep buying them. One thing i like is they are easy to clean with what they are made out of. Oh and they came a whole week and half early haha like 4 days after i ordered them glad it was my day off or i wouldnt have been home at 8am haha

Nice and comfy but the bottoms come unglued after 2 months. Not water proof. Nice looking sneakers but I won't waste money on another pair of these. I feel like I wasted money.

I purchased a pair of these shoes several years ago and they finally bit the dust.  When I went to the shoe store to replace them, there were multiple selections of great tennis shoes in all the new dynamic colors. However, I just wanted my plain ol' leather Nike which I can easily clean and looks half-way dressy for casual outings.  I was delighted to find my shoe on Amazon.  The shoe is great and the service was good too.  Thanks for saving my multiple visits to countless shoe stores.

Nike discontinued this shoe! Shame on them... I have been wearing them for nearly a decade and have bought serval pair for $45-$50... Always the same quality and always a long lasting product. Now the only place I have found them is in Hungary!!! I will continue to buy them until thier supplies run out and I have a closet full...

These shoes look like a bad knock off of Nike shoes. I ordered a size 8.5 and received a size 7. I tried one on and they actually fit even though they said size 7 on the tag.

I did not purchase from this vender but wanted to say that I've had my pair of these exact Nikes for 2 years now.  I'm flat footed and only use them for walking about.

I highly recommend them and great in black...........

These are the most uncomfortable trainers I have ever bought. I though they might bed in, but they will make your heels hurt. They are too hard and are not running shoes, maybe casual shoes or something.  I expected them to be real runners, but you'll be bleeding around your heal if you run or trek. The back heal is made from an unforgiving material that is not cushioned. The sole is overly flat and hard as hell, literally concrete like, its very unforgiving. I have 4 blisters now, incredible rigidness from one end of the shoe to another. I should have stayed with Adidas and went for the cloth type shoes, not this rigid leather type, simply to uncomfortable for training in.

I was a little apprehensive when ordering these - there were a fair few negative reviews that almost dissuaded me from buying - but returning items with Amazon is a breeze (in my experience anyway), so I thought I'd take a chance. And I'm so glad I did.They fit like a glove, and they do one thing incredibly well - something that my Revolution 4's can't do at all: keep my feet bone dry in the rain!I haven't experienced any blisters or chaffing, and they're certainly not fake. Now if you're used to wearing unicorn hide held together by Angel hair on your feet, you may disagree with me here, but they seem to be made of good quality material.They look EXACTLY as pictured. They're really sturdy, yet very comfortable and lightweight. Only time will tell how durable they are, but I'm pretty optimistic on that score. All in all, I'm really happy with them, and I'll quite possibly end up buying second pair.UPDATE: I've been wearing these for a while now, and still no issues with durability or comfort. I'm well over 20 stone, and I've taken some really long hikes in these things - mostly in the pouring rain.  Definitely worth every penny!

After looking at the good & bad reviews, I decided to order a pair of these.I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived, the upper part is definitely leather!!The fit is wide, so great for my feet.The stitching is very strong, these are going to fit like a glove when they soften up.I have a feeling that these are original, & can't recommend them enough.I can't understand why some people have written bad reviews, maybe they did receive counterfeit, I certainly didn't, for the £38 mark they are excellent.

I used these for  the first time to play tennis, which gave them a good test.Seeing that it was quite energetic and I had not played for a while the perfomed well.I did aquire two small blisters as might be anticipated for first time use in such an intense fashion. I don't beleive this will be a long term feature as more use is made of them.My footing was assured with no slipping and generally comfortable to wear.

Quite stiff, may well be because are new. Seem well made and the value was good.EDIT: After a week or so running in the gym with them they are getting comfortable. Stiffness isn't a problem, and they seem to be holding together well with no immediate defects.Size 11 fits perfectly (10.5 is a tad too small for me so these are probably spot on).

This is the third pair of the white ones I've bought, as I keep wearing them out. They are the best trainers I've owned and I use them in all sorts of training, gym-work, cycling, etc. I also own a pair in black, too.I'm a habitual supinator (i.e. too much pressure on the outside of the foot) and have high arches and these trainers do tend to help somewhat with that. They force the foot into a more natural position and help reduce the stress on the outer metatarsals.I would highly recommend these trainers to anyone, for most activities. I'm not much of a runner\jogger so I can't really speak to their performance in that area, but they give great heel support and are very comfy to wear over long periods.

I bought these as a present for my dad for his birthday earlier in the year.He’s had them for a few months now and they show little sign of wear and tear. He’s a major DIY man so is always using them when fixing the house (or mine!) or going on long walks. He also wears them to work on days when he’s driving and not on site.I had to ask him what the best aspects are, but he said:Comfortable: The soles don’t rub at all and are really comfy even after extended use.Breathability: They allow air in to keep your feet cool, something that is nice on not only you but those around you. Noone likes smelly feet after a hard day of work.Design: They look nice and are a great brand, so you know the quality you’re getting when you buy them.Negatives:They are designed for normal feet, which is normal. On wider feet they can be quite tight when first bought but when they’re worn in they’re nice. This isn’t something to be marked down on at all, my dad just needs more normal feet.Overall:Great pair of trainers that look great and are comfortable. Nice price and speedy delivery saved me in the run up to a birthday too. I would (and probably will) definitely buy again!

I've bought this same make the last few years. They are generally good quality, and can last over a year with only minor wear and tear, mostly just colour fading. The tend to break at the back after a year, where the loop is stitched in, and it's then that they need replacing, coz the threading cuts into your ankle from then on.Mine also break on the left front upper big toe knuckle, but that's likely more to do with the bone healing off after a minor break. The right show is usually fine, apart from the aforementioned break after a year or so.

I didn't like these when I first got them - they seemed really badly finished; the leather seemed almost like UPVC, and the edges are really untidy and rough.There is no cushioning compared to running trainers, and at first they seemed quite tight.However, they stretched to fit my wide feet and despite the lack of padding they are actually very comfortable. I am a postman, and walk at least 35 miles a week - since I bought these, I have worn them constantly and they are still going strong,although the hard wearing soles are wearing down quite an extent. I have been using them since the middle of November.The soles are much harder than those on trainers; the toothed patterning works well on grass but is just as bad as most trainers on wet tiles and steps.My feet don't ache too much after wearing them, and considering how long they last, I am very pleased. I've even grown to like the rough appearance they have.Edit 09-05-17: They are still going strong...Edit 25-06-17: a small tear between the breathing holes near the little toe, and a slight lifting of the upper from the sole. See new pictures. They look very worn, but have gone through a lot of miles.

Had my eye on these for a while, snapped them up as soon as I saw them for a good price, seems that they're an old product line and not available generally in this colour way.They're nice and comfortable, run true to size (UK8, EUR 42) and having wide feet, I don't find them too narrow as others have mentioned.The tongues are bit large, and despite minimal wear, I've noticed the sole wearing a bit faster than I'd have liked. The midsoles seem to be painted white and show a bit of creasing at the heels.UPDATE, after a few months of limited wear, only being worn in the dry weather, the sole has split at one of the creases quite badly, despite the rest of the trainers are like new.Let's see how much longer these last before they're unwearable
",2,sad

Took a while to wear in as quite stiff. Size is good but if unsure go half a size up. Not much cushioning in the sole so you may want to add an insole take this into account when picking a size.

I use the shoes to walk on the treadmill in the gym and for that purpose it's fine. However, since it a tennis shoe design, I think it's a little heavy to play tennis in. Confusing since the shoe has 'lite' in its name!The design of the shoe is not as sleek as the pictures depict; the toe area is very wide and ungainly looking. Great in that you get a lot of room to wriggle your toes but it makes the shoe look like camel-hooves.

Great value for money. Fit I a correct aize

The trainers are OK and are as in the pictures, they are exactly what you would expect from the 35 pounds price tag. Leather is quite hard and will take a little breaking in but if you are looking for a brand name trainer at an affordable price then these would suit you.Would recommend.

The shoes arrived on time and were excellent quality and well packaged.  Unfortunately, the size didn't work out, so I had to return, which made me sad as the shoes were great and the price was too.  Sebastian, whom I dealt with, could not have been more helpful .  He went beyond and above to rectify the situation.  I would definitely buy from this company again.  It is not always easy to find good customer service.  Definitely deserve my 5 stars!

I wear 10.5 UK size and ordered 10.5. They are a perfect fit (I didn't need to go a size up). As to them being genuine NIKE (some suggest they aren't).... I have NO reason to think they're not NIKE. Some people simply look for something to complain about. In this case, I have NONE. They've been a good buy.

Been a long time since I had trainers that ripped my heels to pieces on first wear. So much so the blood had ran into the white padding before I noticed, so had to wash before wearing a second time. Will now be on a break-in regime for the next few weeks while the heels soften a bit.

Took straight out of the box and  run five miles  with no issues cant see how anybody can write a bad review of these trainers  run  over thirty miles in these trainers over the first week of purchase  they are  great  very soft under the heel  absorbs a lot of impact  and nice and light to wear

I bought these trainers as I spend a lot of time outdoors, especially in our lovely winters!  I had a very similar previous generation of shoe which I very impressed with which made me plump for them.They are slightly clunky, but when you have inclement weather this is not a bad thing.  However I feel the sole is not the usual Nike quality, as when I came in from being outdoors I was slipping and sliding on the kitchen tiles.  Would be easy to give yourself a sore one.  This is usually what you expect from cheaper branded trainers, and why I usually buy Nike/Adidas.That said, I will use these for the garden instead, but a little bit disappointed.

Great price on runners.  Perfect for school as my son must wear black shoes, these have a bit of support in them.  The new runners today are mostly made of this mesh that constantly wears a hole in the shoe in no time at all.  After buying three pairs of the mesh shoes in a short space we changed gears hopefully these will wear a bit better.  They seem in principle to be a sturdier pair.

Now I'm not the most trainer savvy. I need comfy non-slip trainers that I can wear at work when climbing across desks running cables. It's about the only running I do.I discovered these back in 2011 and usually buy 2 pairs a year, every year ... but not any more.The last three pairs have all failed in the same way due to a change in the manufacturing process.The plastic 'heel plate' shatters and cuts on through the material rubbing the back of your foot to the point of blistering. It takes about 8 weeks of wear, I normally get 26 weeks of hard wear 12-14 hours a day.Hopeless.It's appalling considering the price has doubled over the last eight years.Avoid these budget rip offs.

I had a previous pair of these shoes, they lasted well over a year and a half and where comfy enough so I bought another pair. This revision of the shoes have clearly been made with much cheaper materials as they are in a worse condition than my previous pair after 4 months vs 16+.

These are the most uncomfortable trainers I have ever bought. I though they might bed in, but they will make your heels hurt. They are too hard and are not running shoes, maybe casual shoes or something.  I expected them to be real runners, but you'll be bleeding around your heal if you run or trek. The back heal is made from an unforgiving material that is not cushioned. The sole is overly flat and hard as hell, literally concrete like, its very unforgiving. I have 4 blisters now, incredible rigidness from one end of the shoe to another. I should have stayed with Adidas and went for the cloth type shoes, not this rigid leather type, simply to uncomfortable for training in. The trainers are most likely fake as they are so uncomfortable. They do come in a Nike box, made in India, but they will cut your feet to ribbons, really disappointing.

Soles completely fell apart in less than 2 months. Rubber inserts fell out at heel allowing water to soak right through shoe. Glue fell apart showing how thin the rubber sole is, a few millimeters. Have bought these shoes from reputable retailers many times before and all have lasted at least 1 1/2 years. These are extremely poor quality, stay well clear.

I bought these runners for my son who was given them as an early Christmas present (Dec 1st).  They have completely fallen apart.  The stitching has disintegrated and the sole of the shoe has come apart from the actual shoe!  I have never seen anything like it in my life.  There must have been something wrong with the stitching as they fell apart within 3 weeks.  I am not sure if they were fakes, but I can't believe that Nike would produce such poor quality shoes.  I would think twice before purchasing just in case.....

Would of been nice if had came in a box. The shoes came in a clear bag. They don’t looked used but do have creasing on shoes due to the packing. No paper was left in side shoes to prevent the creasing.  So they may look pressed because of delivery. I’m sure with other packages it may have caused weight to press against the shoes to form a small bit of creasing. Other then that shoes were good and look new so for the price not bad at all.

These are great shoes.  The prior pair (size 6) was getting too small for my son (11Y) and he liked them so much that he wanted the exact same style.  In particular, the soles and toe caps are fairly flexible if you do not like a firm/hard sneaker.  We ended up getting a size 8 (which probably begs the question how he fits into the size 6 without having to scrunch his toes?!?).One thing I also noticed is that the size 8 shoes do not have the loop on the back to provide assistance with pulling on the shoe.  I wasn't sure if this was a feature they removed from the latest iteration of the shoe.  Or maybe this feature only exists on sub-7 'youth' sizes and does not exist in 'adult' sizes?  I wish it was still there, but I guess Nike was able to cut costs by removing the little loop.

They are as comfortable as I expected; however, the sneakers do not have a traditional tongue as one would expect.  The tongueless design makes them a little harder to get on if you like them tied tight as I do.

Shoes fit and look great, but the downside is that every single rock gets stuck at the bottom of the crevices in the sole of the shoe, and I find myself constantly having to pick rocks off every time I go inside my house :( Poor design of the bottom side of the sole.Happenes to all 3 pairs of Nike Free Runs I bought.

The shoe looks good and seems well made. My son wears 10.5 and has wide feet so these were too narrow for him and had to be sent back. I should've bought a 10.5W had I known how tight they'd be on his foot. Otherwise, it's a very lightweight shoe with the right hints of color.

I initially got a size 9.5 because that is what fit with previous models of the Free Run shoe.  This new model added leather material to the toe for extra support so, I had to up size to a 10 and they now fit perfect!

I have been wearing nothing but Frees since they were introduced. There have been many variations over the years. This version is the best so far. And the design goes back close to the original.

I will quit buying Nikes. That's all I got.

Disappointed with the amount of money I paid, Not comfortable at all. I have to replace the soles because it is so Hard on bottom. I’m not sure if they are made by Nike. Good flexibility and light. I will assure you that you will need to buy a pair of better soles. Not worth for the price!

These shoes are for people with narrow feet!  Folks with wide feet should steer clear of these shoes.  The shoes are more like a sock style and thus, the shoe last is designed to accommodate narrow, flat feet.  Thick and wide feet (as mine) absolutely do not fit in these shoes.  I wear a 10.5 sneaker size and my feet made these shoes look like they were stuffed with a sausage!

This newer Free isn’t the same as the older version! They are okay but the sole of the shoe is inferior to the older models of which I wore many versions of. The rubber is not as soft, plush or responsive! That is just a fact so buyer beware. The shoe soles in this version is not the same as the older models.

There's no tongue which makes the shoe harder to get on. They also feel like your walking on a hard surface. There is no cushion at all compared to all my other nikes. No arch support either. Basically just a barrier between you and the pavement. I got these because I was replacing the 2018 Nike free run I had just worn out. Those were amazingly comfortable. These are just awful. If you get them plan on placing in an orthotic.

Great looking and light weight. This shoe has a design feature I wasn't aware of when I ordered it, a sewn in tung that I absolutely dislike. So far it's been very difficult to get my foot inside the shoe. I have to fight it every time I go to put these shoes on. The tung is made of web material and I'm assuming they though it would be stretchable enough to not be an issue?  I would really like to return these shoes but once they're on I'm happy. I hoping the material will stretch over time but maybe I'll have to resort to breaking out my scissors.

These are great running shoes. They have really helped my plantar fasciitis along with some good insoles. They are a little bit shallow though.

These sneakers are awesome. They fit perfectly. As a reference I am a 7 1/2 women's. I ordered a size 6 and they fit perfectly. Kids shoes run about 1 1/2 sizes smaller than women's so if your a women's 9, order a kids 7 1/2 etc. They are extremely comfortable shoes, very light weight and the laces stayed tied all day long! A reviewer mentioned these were counterfeit Nikes so I was a little skeptical. I only wear Nike and these are NOT counterfeit, they are real Nikes. They do feel a little stiff right out of the box but after walking around my house for about 15 minutes they were fine. Definitely recommend.

The black Pegasus 37 has flimsy plastic loops for the laces which are spot glued.  They break open after a few uses.  Very poor quality. The other colour Nike Pegasus 37 have string lace holders like all the older models had.  Could it be that these black Nikes are cheap fakes?

I thought by ordering a full size bigger than what my daughter currently wears would be enough, but these shoes are barely bigger than her old shoes. She loves them anyway, and was super excited for her new shoes. She'll run them to death, so I'm not too worried about her out growing them. But I did think they would be a little bigger size than they are.I still fully recommend these shoes

This is most uncomfortable running shoes I ever bought. Simply I can not run with this pair. It hurts my feet. I have 2 pairs of zoom turbo 2 and those are so comfy running both upper part and bottom sole and I don't get tired at all but this Peg 37, too snag, sole is stiff, upper pressure is so  hurting my feet. I have tried to break in for third time attempt today but it still hurts me and can not run at all.

The one thing I dislike about this shoe is that is has little to none ankle support. I would highly recommend this shoe for tempo runs and road running. What ever you you do do not go on a trail run with these shoes. It's still a very nice shoe.

I usually wear size 8 when wearing regular shoes. Ever since I started using Nike running shoes, I found out I needed to go up 1/2 inch. I have wide feet, and these Nike running shoes are well fitted for slimmer feet. If you do have wide feet, consider adding 1/2 inch to your size.

Girls sizes usually run smaller than boys. So the description says girls but invoice said boys. These were definitely boys sizing, I got a 4 1/2 and it was slightly larger than the 5s I purchased previously on here that were too big. But it seems like a very good quality shoe but no 4s available to exchange, I guess I will wear thick socks.

Love these shoes. They’re comfortable and cute. Very easy to wipe clean if you step in mud. Totally worth the order! The only thing I would recommend is use your sizing from the actual store - I have never worn Nike before these, so I went to the store to get sized first and I’m glad I did! They fit as expected - but I wear a 7.5 normally. And the Nike - I wear 6.5 kids. Odd, right?

One star to credit the look and style of the shoe. At face value, they are very nice looking shoes. But the fabric, or something the shoe is made of inside, is surely of lower grade quality because it created a terrible stench! Yes, WITH socks (no bare feet). My daughter has worn all kinds of tennis shoes and different brands, too. This was the very first time we ever had an experience like this and she’s had great Nike’s before! The materials in this shoe needs a QA review. I’m also not sure where these shoes were stored and who they came from, but something is definitely off here.

I remember the first time I put my feet in a pair of Nike Pegasus more than 30 years ago. It felt like wrapping my feet in a soft blanket. I've had many different pairs of Pegasus since, my last being a pair of version 34s. But I'm returning these new 37s because the style has totally deteriorated. Most fundamentally, the sizing ran too small this time, too short for my foot in a style that had always been correctly sized before. But I'm not going to mess with trying a larger size because the other drawbacks are too great and too many. Almost all the cushioning is gone, particularly in the tongue of the shoe which is now just thin nylon mesh fabric with even thinner material at the top where laces will cut into one's foot. Just to compare, I slipped on an old, old pair of Pegasus 27s I keep for working in the yard and found there the nice cushioned material throughout that is completely missing from the current version. Back to the new 37s, the heel is a mess, not just the needless boat prow point which other reviewers have noted, but also the fact that it doesn't rise nearly enough (other than another sharp point) to properly surround and grip my heel and prevent slipping. It all looks like ways to save on materials while hiding it with a new seemingly stylish design. I've put lots of miles on Nike Pegasus's, but won't be putting any on these before they're returned.
",1,sad
"
What I received look to be previously owned shoes in a plain cardboard box.  These were not advertised as such.  Also, what does ""frustration free packaging"" even mean? (see photo).  Those are nonsense words and more an excuse for not sending out a NEW pair of running shoes.Mean to be clear, this shouldn't be on Nike, but on the seller for doing this.  Nike kicks have always been good to me.
",1,angry
"
This is my second pair of Nike Pegasus, the first pair lasted two years. I got these new ones two months ago and have yet to be able to walk in them without my feet hurting. It’s like there’s too much your feet sit too high in them and the right side squeezes your foot. I’ve worn the same size Nike shoes for 10+ years and have never had an issue. These things are $100+ that will just sit in the close until donated one day. I would suggest getting an older version of these or just something else period.
",1,sad

Have been using Nike Pegasus styles for a while now and always very satisfied with performance. However, this model gave me a lot of problems. Initially, felt alright, but later gave me foot pain that required a visit to the podiatrist. Found out had inflammation in a joint and required cortisone injection. Pain immediately vanished, but later came back after 2 weeks of using the shoe. Next day, changed shoes to Pegasus 36 and no further problems. Nout sure whether design of shoe was changed (point of toes are offset and towards inside direction) to cause problem.

Ordered these for my son (didn't see it said girls shoes prior to purchasing). Ordered his correct size and they fit perfectly. He likes them and wears them often.

Nike Air max feature a air ""pillow"" for comfort. Have purchased these shoes for years. This pair lasted less than a month.

These shoes are great if all your doing is planning to run for exercise. I like to either start or end my workouts with a 3-4 mile run. Being in motion with these shoes feels great but standing in em does not. They have an odd design suited for running but not standing. Along with a really out of place tie station, that curves to the sides of the foot. All in all I don’t hate em but I’m not crazy about it, especially considering the price.

Longtime fan of Nike Air Zoom Pegasus so decided to give this version a try. The style of the shoe compares favorably with its previous iterations but that's about all I liked. Pegasus 37 boasts ""improved technology"" in that it's a lighter-weight shoe with an enhanced footbed and low-profile heel design. I'm sure these changes will suit many wearers but I found the lightness oddly uncomfortable, as though my feet weren't really secure in the shoe. The tongue is much thinner; for me, taking away that padding means I feel the laces nudging my instep in a noticeable way. The socks I wear have a padded ""lip"" which cushions and protects the curve of the heel from irritation on longer runs. The heel of the Pegasus 37 just didn't seem as snug; I felt it slipping up and down with every step. Took 'em out for a spin around the block, on concrete and some unpaved roads; based on my experience, couldn't recommend for long runs. I'll stick with my sturdy Pegasus 34's. Donated the 37's to our local homeless shelter. (Actually met the guy who got them and he said they were really comfortable as he walks a lot. Different strokes.)
",3,sad

Not sure about the reason, I use other Nike shoes models without problems but this one, even the same numebr size, it felt smaller for me, like narrower. The orange pipe is really fluo.

I love the fit and feel of this shoe and that it is nice and light.  However I had to take off a couple stars because when walking on hard surface (indoors) the soles make a terrible squeaking sound with every step that just drives me crazy.  Nike needs to redesign the soles.
",3,neutral
"
While standing and walking you can’t really feel the benefits or cushioning however once you start sprinting and jogging the shoe comes to life offering great rebound and impact protection.Size ran a little on the smaller side for me and I had to use a runners knot to prevent heel slip.A good shoe for HIIT and short runs.

I own the Nike Zoom Pegasus 37 BQ9646-011.I had high hopes that this would finally be a shoe that was as good as my old Pegasus 30.I'm an amateur runner that does races for fun and need a shoe that above all else will PROTECT ME. I don't need a shoe that is 10 micro grams lighter to that I can beat Eliud Kipchoge. I just need something that is strong, well cushioned and will protect my feet, knees and back from the rigors of long distance running.Regarding this shoe: At first I tried it and felt a bit weird when running. It seems the support is more towards the middle of the shoe than on the heel. Then, as others have also reported, the shoe started causing me pain in the tendon right over my heels. The pain got worse and worse. So I had to stop using them. (And they're expensive)Today I tried on my 8 year old Pegasus 30, and not only did they provide much better support, my feet felt much firmer. And the pain caused by the other shoes was not present, even though my tendon still feels tender. It's odd that a worn out shoe performed better and protects me better than this new model.Nike if you're reading this: please go back to making excellent running shoes like the Pegasus 30. And stop doing the ""Apple"" thing and ruining a perfectly good performing shoe with versions like the 37. I'll happily buy a 30 again.. I just can't find one.

Nike Pegasus Zoom running shoes are my favorite, Zoom 36 & 38. These 37 are a disappointment, very different look and feel, compared to my previous versions and experiences. They feel cheaply made and look generic, almost like knock offs. I would have returned these if I could but I’ve worn them to break them in. The shoes are just not what I was expecting or used to from previous Nike shoe experience.No issues with the seller.

not as cushiony as the race running shoe, the one that the heel protrudes out the back. so for comfort only 4 stars but i gave it 5 because it is good enough if u dont have foot problems and is a great looking shoe in the blue color. so for looks it gets 5 stars. so technically 4.5 stars. if it was a bit more cushiony like the wild horse it would have gotten a 5. for the trail the wild horse trail shoe gets 5 stars- tread sticks to treacherous trails, and its cushion is awesome even my worn ones still good.

As a long time WFH employee, I had gotten in a habit of buying cheaper and cheaper shoes because I wasn't really on my feet on a daily basis.  These shoes are reminding me why that is such. A bad idea...These shoes are a performance running shoe but I use them for daily wear and about 3 to 4 walks per week.  I can't think of any cons at this point.They are super light but they also provide very good foot support.  I feel like the width is just right and the uppers are light but also prevent lateral sliding.  Most sneakers that I wore in the past were either light or supportive but not both.  It might be because the shoe does seem to fit my foot perfectly.  I know that might not be the case for everyone else.I would definitely recommend these, especially since the price won't break the bank.

According to others reviews the shoe is a tad bit smaller than others, but I typically buy bike and find they are no different than all other Nike pairs I have used. These fit perfectly and are quite comfortable.  I work on my feet in hospitals and can wear these without any problems being on my feet 13 hrs.  Precisely as advertised in my opinion.  Good price and if you want to be certain they will fit correctly get a half size larger.

I've been a runner for the past thirty years.  In that time, I've worn lots of running shoes, but I've never worn a pair of shoes that I would write a review for.  Sure- folks have told me about buying a certain pair of shoes, and how awesome they were.  So I went out and bought them, and they were OK.  But these shoes are amazing.  I like them so much that I often use them for just walking (which as a runner, I know I'm not supposed to do...I don't care.  I like them that much).  Bottom line- this is a phenomenal shoe, so much so, that I had to write this review.

I’ve been using them for running short distances and they are pretty comfy and have great response and bounce. Not sure if they would be ideal for a marathon, they are great for 5k, 10k or even 15k.I also followed the size chart and they are my size, they fit ok but they are a bit tight, I might have gone for half size bigger.

My NIKE Air Zooms Pegasus 37’s -ROCK!

The look and feel great, and do appear to be excellent for running. I normally order a half size up for my running and sports shoes which I did in this case; they still feel quite snug even without socks on! It was an international delivery for me, so there's no point exchanging. I'll suggest to order a full size up from your regular shoe size.

Apparently heel slip is a Nike trademark. I normally wear New Balance shoes but it is impossible to find them in size 45 in Thailand so I had to switch to Nike. First thing I noticed was the annoying heel slip. Did a Google and found out this is a problem with the Pegasus 37, although there have been complaints with the 36 too.The Nikes are simplistic shoes compared to New Balance. New Balance has sophisticated soles which often use dual compounds (I like their Adzorb material in particular). Nike just uses one type of hard foam. New Balance shoes rarely have the heel slip problem because they have deeper heel pockets. The problem with the Nikes is the shoes are like canoes - really long, so when you walk you torque the rear heel section away from your foot. The heel slip problem is worse if you use arch support soles, which often have elevated and cushioned heel platforms, which further rises your heel higher in the shoe.The only good things I can say about the Pegasus 37 is the sole is thick and cushy (or spongey). And the tongue is thin, lightweight fabric for comfort, so the shoe laces up well (the New Balance has issues with the laces nearest the toes not snugging up well, particularly if the shoe is a tad oversize). As far as durability of the sole (and whether the hard rubber laminate separates over time as with the New Balance), remains to be seen.UPDATE: Some of the reviewers have mentioned the heel slip goes away once the shoe has 'broken in'. I found this to be true. What happens is the spongy sole tends to break in and collapse after a few weeks of use, so your heel sinks lower in the shoe and the length of the laces increase. If you look at the sole from the side, you can see a length-wise fold or crimp in the sole as it doubles over and collapses. The problem is, these are running shoes! So the shoes feel less cushy now. As a result, I am starting to get some soreness in my knee, beneath the kneecap. I walk 3-6 miles a day, 5 days a week, to get around Bangkok, which is a large city.I've decided to get rid of these shoes and have gone back to New Balance, as I didn't have any knee problems with them. To have running shoes change their morphology or structure after use is unacceptable. New Balance shoes stay the same the day you buy them; the soles don't lose their compressibility. Here in Thailand, New Balance shoes cost twice the price of Nikes but it's not worth it to hurt your knee to save the extra $$$.

Bought these to replace my pegasus 36 but had to return as they were too narrow compared to the 36.The 37s were much softer and had a good bounce. The 37 had all the makings of a good shoe but even going a half size up it was too narrow on the forefoot and the top where the laces are. Going a full size up would definitely made for slippage while running.Maybe the 37s were not made for my feet. I'll try the 38s when they come out.

When I go to the gym, I spend a lot of time on the elliptical and the treadmill. This shoe is ideal because the cushioning is so comfortable, when I am running on the treadmill, I close my eyes and it feels like I am running on top of the clouds. Very nice comfort and fit, and very useful toward the purpose for which it is used. Nike is the only company I will buy athletic shoes from.

Recently taken up running through the Covid lock down and after a few weeks of running on an entry level Karrimor trainer I decided I needed to upgrade. Didn't want to spend a fortune so spent time reading reviews and decided upon these. I'm finding them really excellent and making a massive difference to any aches and pains I used to get after running. It feels like I'm running on air when I've got them on and definitely made the right choice. Amazon were the cheapest even compared to the Nike on-line store with discount. Delivery was excellent too. All in all I'm massively happy with these.

They're the first running shoes I've ever bought and with all the great reviews I thought they'd be perfect. They're ok. They're very narrow, too narrow, wish there was more space as I'm going further and further with them and my feet are starting to swell now and I thought they'd be more cushioned, even over time. I think they're probably better for sprinting but not jogging. They look amazing though, I really like the design. I just think there's probably better running shoes out there, especially for the price.

My son wears these to school, being a cross between a trainer and acceptable school  footwear. The main part of it is a thick mesh which lets your feet breathe but doesn't offer weatherproofing.

Comfy fit however quality isn't their for these as right foot has hard lump on material at front that when walking you can occasionally feel. But I used a voucher on these and got the for £20.

Bought these as school shoes for my grandson as he’s at the age where he refuses to wear conventional ones.

Despite this I will definitely buy them again.

I have been wearing Nike Pegasus for running for the last 15-20 years. It has always been my go to option for comfort. The Pegasus 37 though seems to be a complete redesign which is actually killing my feet every time I wear them.Nike Pegasus have always been suited to neutral attenuation feet but these don't seem to be. When running, or even just walking in them the tension causes pain in the arches of the feet.Looking at the soles of the shoes there is a outer rim of dark rubber obviously designed to absorb pressure but even after wearing them just a few times I can see wear in the central hollow of the shoes. This means that the un-cushioned central area is the part coming into contact with the ground.Another clear design floor is the back of the shoe which is lower than normal and tapered. I'm not sure why Nike felt the need to have a pointed end at the back of the shoe but it means the heel does not feel fully cushioned or supported and has a tendency to slip up and down.I am really shocked at how badly designed these running shoes are and I can only advise others to avoid them like the plague.

Had these 4 months and use them for work. Very comfortable. However, im very unhappy as I have a hole in both shoes, in the fabric, where my big toe is. I could understand if I had had them for a while. Not very good quality if this happens after several months.

Had to return these as my son didn't like the way they stick out at the back, they have pointy sole at the back that looks daft. Shame as otherwise they would have been great.

I originally bought these for my Forrest Gump haloween costume (I couldn’t find Nike Cortez anywhere) and it turns out I wear these more than any of my shoes now. I work in a business causal professional environment so they’re perfect for work with chinos and a button up or with jeans and a tee.

Good quality but the tongue on the left shoe slides into the sneaker. Annoying.The tongue slot and laces line up so I don't think that is it.

In the description of the shoes it said that they are made of leather. When I received them, it was clear that they are not leather and inside they had a sticker saying ""UPPER CONTAINS SYNTHETIC LEATHER"". Therefore they are not shoes made of leather but synthetic leather.

Ordered canvas court legacy and leather came. Not what was described at all. Clearly says “canvas upper” . Leather version runs half size smaller and makes it wrong size and wrong style. Always a waste of time to get a package that wasn’t as advertised. Now you know!

Was excited to get these, but when they arrived I was disappointed to find that the leather was extremely stiff and hard and didn't even feel like genuine leather. Needless to say, it makes the shoes very uncomfortable to wear. I had the same experience with a pair of shoes that ended up being copycat knock off shoes made to look just like the name brand. I'm feeling like I've been taken again. I would say buy elsewhere and play it safe. These aren't comfortable anyway. 2 thumbs down  👎👎

I bought white and black.  white fit perfect bought both same size black had to be replaced 2 more times till correct in size

I want to love these…they are SO cute, but the left shoe has a horrible seam right at the joint of my pinky toe and it makes it impossible to wear these for very long. This makes them super uncomfortable and painful.

I didn't like the feel of the material. A cloth type material is not really durable. Maybe if the price was under 30.00  but at $68.00 that was way over priced.

See in the picture how back of shoe points back at your heel? This feels oddly tight at first, BUT when you start walking or trying to wear these for more than 10 minutes, it’s very painful and tears the skin off of both heals! I tried bandaids bc I was not home to change my shoes, but it peals the bandaids off too. Three weeks after this occurrence and my heels are still healing. Didn’t wear them for long period of time until I’d had them a month so now they’re non-returnable. 🤦🏻‍♀️

The Nike Air Max 2017 Men's Running Shoes are a great option for people looking for comfortable and stylish shoes. The shoes feature a sleek and modern design, with a breathable mesh upper that allows for maximum airflow and keeps feet cool and dry. While it's coined a ""running shoe"", I don't think this would be a great shoe for serious runners. To me, it's better labeled a ""casual shoe"". Two reasons for this:· It's actually a pretty heavy shoe.· The rebound isn't all that responsive.For a casual shoe, one of the standout features of these shoes is the Air Max cushioning system, which provides shock absorption and support. We've owned previous versions of this same shoe without the shock absorption- there's a big difference. The cushioning is good for long walks, providing the necessary support and comfort.The outsole of the Air Max 2017 is made of durable rubber for traction and durability. The outsole also features a waffle pattern that helps to grip the ground, making it comfortable to walk on a variety of surfaces. The outsole also features a flex groove design which allows for a natural range of motion and a more efficient stride.The fit of the shoe is true to size. The shoes also have a padded collar and tongue for added comfort and support. My son has worn the shoes for three days. While he is happy with the overall fit, the toe box may be a little shallow which has caused him to trip a few times. I am sure this will improve with time.Overall, these Nike shoes are a good option for a casual shoe that provides a comfortable, supportive, and stylish shoe. I only rated the shoes as four stars because Nike continues to call this a running shoe when it's actually a casual shoe. Hopefully, Nike will eventually separate casual athletic shoes from true running shoes.

I actually bought the “used” pair. As stated, they were used like new and they were. Bottom of shoes were clean and so was the inside. The shoes are just what I was expecting. The only thing I don’t like is that the tongue is stitched to the shoe not allowing a full free open motion on it. Overall I’m happy with my purchase.

Like the color and fit after stretching them with a shoe stretcher for 48hrs . Stil need to stretch them a bit more for the perfect feel and fit. So if you going to buy and have wide and high feet buy a bigger size or prepare to stretch them for a while.

It's a good shoes, just as what I expect from usual Nike air max series.The only complaint is that each time I wear it, I have to adjust my shoes tongue by simply pulling it a bit.It's a very simple task, but also a bit annoying (without doing it, I fee immediate small pain).

The 2017 Nike Air Max has been my favorite shoe since I first tried them on.

The first 2 months this shoe was amazing. I felt like I was walking on clouds. I rarely used them in the beginning but once I started really using them the third month I noticed the squeaked constantly and I didn’t know why. After awhile I noticed my right lower back started hurting I thought it was because of maybe the way I sat down? Or from working out. BUT after reading some of these reviews it’s because the right side shoe popped and my balance was off when I walked! Once I bought some different shoes the pain stopped. I paid almost $200 for these shoes and they didn’t even make it over 5 months of really minimal use. I will NEVER EVER buy another pair of these shoes again and will be contacting someone about the poor quality. Only reason I gave it a 2 was because the look cool even if they did screw up my back.

I’ve bought tons of Nike sneakers and they come a pretty standard way. These sneakers almost had a feel as though they were refurbished.

When I first got these I put in some running insoles which felt awful, way too much support up front, digging into the balls of the feet. The included insoles don't have that problem but also offer no arch support. If you wear these in for a few weeks, the front gets less firm and normal running insoles feel great.

I have ordered this same shoe and size at least 5 times over this pair had some different pattern, different soles, didn’t come in the original manufacturer box, and was too small to fit my foot despite the tag saying it was a 10.5 which is what I always get for this exact shoe. Clearly a fake knockoff scam.

I am a woman who owns Nike Tanjun sneakers in various colors, so I ordered these for my son.  He agrees that these are the best feeling sneakers he has ever worn!  He has been wearing them for months, and they still look & feel like new.  They are totally fashionable, but most of all, they offer extreme comfort that you just can't find in other sneakers.  The fit is true to size,  but most MEN can go up 1/2 size for the best comfort you've ever felt.  The Fashion & Comfort factors are 100 stars!!!  (And btw, my 90 year old dad also LOVES wearing Nike Tanjuns, and his 73 yr old wife too!  Proof that these are not just for 18 yr olds! :)  Best to wait & get them when the price is equal or lower than shopping at DSW or other online shoe stores.  Enjoy!

As others have noted there isn't a whole lot of support and ironically, it's biggest advantage is also its biggest drawback... Not as much support, feet slide a little. And for some reason (materials?) these shoes absorb foot odor too well. After 2 month I was shocked to smell my shoes after 2-3 runs a week. On the positives side they do well in the washer. A gentle cycle and light amount of detergent had them smelling and looking like new.

Wanted to get some Roshe's for nostalgia's sake, but learned that they're not in production anymore. This was the next best thing in production. They're comfortable, but just very narrow. I wouldn't want to wear these for long periods of time, every day, because I care about foot health

I’m a painting contractor and on my feet all day, so when I googled top 10 most comfortable shoes, these were #1 with Adidas cloudfoam ultimate #2 (or visa versa). Then I found these here on AMZN, and after reading all the excellent reviews about them, I decided to purchase. Well, I wear a size 11, so I ordered a pair of cloudfoam ultimates and a pair of these in my size, but these are too short. My big toe is about to bust through the fabric when walking around my house for 5 min. So I’m returning and because they don’t have an 11-1/2 available in the color I want, I purchased another pair of cloudfoam ultimates. With that being said, these shoes are extremely comfortable and lightweight. Almost can’t even tell I’m wearing shoes. If they had a half size larger, I would have exchanged for a pair that fit.

Never been a Nike shoe fan but wanted to give these shoes a try since its on Google's Top 10 most comfortable shoes list and voted #2.

I tried 2 pairs of these and both are rather snug, so if you're on the fence as to whether to go with what should fit or a half size larger, go the half size larger.  Stuck with them now, because I'm beyond the return window thinking that perhaps they'd loosen up after a few good walks.  They haven't at all.

If you need to get new tennis shoes I can not recommend this pair enough. They are my favorite sneaker of all time. I'm seriously debating if I should get another 'back up' pair in case Nike stops making them down the road so I will have another pair when I wear these out. I got them bc I have to start wearing some custom orthotics daily due to collapsed arches and  I liked these b/c you can 'dress' them up a little bit for sneakers. But they are so light, breathable and like walking on a very supportive cloud if that makes sense. The mesh is flexible so it will accommodate bunions too if you have them (they stretch out for my orthotics nicely). I show up for happy hours in them and ppl say outfits are 'cute' so they really do the dress up role nicely.  I'm so happy with them. I got a men's size - I'm a 9 in women's and  ordered an 8 men's and they fit perfect.

I’m a woman and I just followed their sizing chart and bought based on my foot length in cm. Fits perfectly with just enough extra room at the toe box. Super comfortable and lightweight. Best running shoes

First thing’s first. I’m a size 8 1/2 in women’s because I am, in fact, a woman. I just don’t like most of the women’s shoes and the ones I’ve looked at didn’t match the gym outfit I got. So I searched through men’s shoes, found this and just accommodated for my actual shoe size. They fit great, are awesome to workout in and match my outfit perfectly. 100% worth it for the price, the only way you could ruin these is if you ran around in these without taking care of them. I only use them indoors because of quarantine but I’m sure they’d be good for outside too as long as you’re not roughing it up by hiking a lot.

I've owned Nike shoes in the past but for some reason these shoes are just okay. I really can't put my finger on it but something just seems to be off pudding about these certain shoes. I guess over all they're okay but they just seem to have a cheap feel to them and they don't seem to fit as well as other Nike shoes I've owned. In closing all I can really say is if you're buying a pair of Nike shoes don't go cheap just lay out some cash and give your feet a true treat.

This shoe is my second choice in footwear. Payless Shoe Store, now closed, had great, inexpensive mesh shoes.  After they closed, I was adrift trying to find comfortable shoes that really fit.

I have ankle pain from standing for 24+ hours in the ICU rounding (also have excessive eversion of my feet and some peroneal tendonitis from a tennis injury). I had tried compression socks and wearing an AFO brace to help. These helped some but since switching to these shoes 2 months ago...my pain is practically gone. I probably just needed to replace my older new balances (worn for 12 months) but still....very happy with this shoe thus far. Light weight, breathable, and not too expensive. Im in the NICU so unlikely to get major spills so I didn't really care about water resistance.

I almost never bother to leave reviews, but these were good enough for me to write one. I have very flat feet, and need a lot of arch support, so I have been a repeat Nike customer for many years now.  I often get knee and/or foot pain from formal shoes, so I was also looking for running shoes that look nice enough to be acceptable in a business casual office environment.  These fit the bill perfectly on both counts.Bonus for being the lightest sneakers I have ever bought.

Product came very clean but had some decal defects. Some stitching was in the Nike logo. So you can clearly see the blue stitching inside the white nike logo. They fit well but are very snug. I usually buy 11.5 to have a little room but this 11.5 was exact fit. I will say that they are very comfortable and they breathe very well, keeping your feet cool.

I bought these for my husband for his birthday, he liked the actual shoe, but they came used.

Have gout and a somewhat flat foot.  I also do not like when my toe jams into the rubber part of the front of all other shoes I have.  I have really nice Asics Gel Kayanos and would have sworn they were the most comfortable shoes.  The only issue is the support around the front sometimes cramps my toes in.  When I put these Nike Tanjuns on, I discovered the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn.  The entire front of the shoe is loose fabric and the sole is a flat memory foam material.  Feels like I am wearing a super comfortable sock.  I have now purchased 5 pairs of these shoes in different colors.  I am the type of person who will buy as many of something as I can if I am worried the style or feel will change in the future. That being said, I will wear my Asics for extreme sporting activities and the Tanjuns for everything else.

It looks great but it was not a true size 12.( More like an 11.)

These are the most comfortable sneakers I've ever worn. I've worn plenty of Asics and even Brooks shoes because I figured a great running shoe would be a great walking shoe but it turns out I was wrong. These are the best walking shoes I've ever worn. The mesh is extra breathable so your feet stay dryer and the shoes won't smell bad as quickly. The cushion provided by these shoes is fantastic. I think there is something to the flat bottom shoes because Asics always have a recess on the bottom so your heel won't hit the ground. I think this actually causes my ankle to pronate and is generally a less comfortable design. It's also worth noting that I have a slightly wide and flatter foot and these are still a great fit. Overall great pair of shoes and I'd highly recommend them.

I spend long hours on my feet and was in constant pain with my old shoes, despite the fact that they had claimed to be good for just those sort of conditions. After two months of wearing these ones, I have no pain at all. When I first put them on, they felt great, but I still had the residual pain from before, so I couldn't really tell how these would pan out. It took a while for my feet to heal but now all the pain in my arches and toes is gone, so I would highly recommend these to anyone suffering from foot pain due to long hours of standing and walking and also to anyone who has to work under those conditions and wants to avoid pain. Plus they look great. (I got the blue ones.)

So, I had actually bought the same pair of shoes 4 years back. They lasted me 3 years and were perfect for everything, from working at my warehouse job, to hiking, and running. Can't wait for these pair to last me a while as well. These are very comfortable and durable shoes, highly recommend these to anyone looking for THAT shoe, this is THE ONE. Whether it be, casual wear, sport, work, this is your GO TO shoe. Looking forward to making more memories with these pair of shoes.

I’ve been wearing these shoes very regularly for about 14 months. Here’s the short:Pros: These are pretty comfortable and good if you’re on your feet all day and want shoes that can assist in delaying heel pain.Cons: The tread is GONE. I’ve found myself slipping and sliding for a few months to the point that it’s time to retire these permanently. I’d keep wearing if the tread lasted longer, but it just hasn’t help up even to relatively light use after one year.Conclusion: Worth it, but look for a sale, because they probably won’t last as long as you’d like.

The inside of the shoe is not black like in the picture. The souls and top of the shoe doesn't even say Nike like it does in the picture! They are comfortable shoes and they keep your feet cool but i feel lied too. they are also a very bright white when out in the sun.

IMO this is Nike's best running shoe, if not their best shoe they made ever. It's comfortable, lightweight, and smooth which is what I look for in a shoe. It is almost the perfect shoe ever, except for one thing. It will not protect your feet from getting wet in the rain or snow. This shoe is much better in the gym or warm weather, but if that doesn't faze you, like it didn't faze me, than get this shoe.

I love these for running and day to day wear. So comfy, I love the sleek minimalist style, no gawdy colors or design, and they breathe! I plan on buying more (colors) of these as long as Nike makes them. $70 feels a little steep for how light these are, but hey... It's Nike. Only downside is that the material is tough to clean, so maybe avoid white.

My son loves these shoes. He’s a young boy so he is constantly growing. And he likes to run and play basketball. He wears out a pair of shoes pretty fast.

We stopped wearing those shoes and went back to these. He now has no foot pain. This seems to be a great shoe that supports the heels and arches.

I have purchased many pairs of Nike running shoes over the years from shoe stores, including Macy's. I always purchase size 10 and all have fit perfectly and comfortably. This pair I ordered through Amazon (size 10) are very tight fit, almost as though a half size too small. I am not sure if I should keep them. I am let down in that I can't trust websites selling a name brand shoe and then not fitting as those purchased inside of a store. Buyer beware.

These are my favorite Nikes and I have 3 pairs. One is a women’s 7.5 and the others are boy’s 5.5. They all fit the same ( I think Nike runs small and I have wide feet, so I get a half size up). The fabric is stretchy and these are so easy to machine wash. I wear them to work often and they hold up well. I work in retail full time and I’m on my feet 8-12 hours daily. I’m also in my 40’s with heel spurs and sciatica. Good shoes are life changing!

Last year I ordered these exact same sneakers. The fit and comfort was perfect. I loved them and,  therefore, I ordered another pair this summer. I was disappointed with the new pair. The new pair is smaller and tighter although it is the exact same size, 9.5, as the older ones. What I noticed on the label is that last year's pair was made in Indonesia. This year's pair is made in Vietnam.  Nike's specs shrunk in the process. If in doubt, order larger.

The shoes fit my husband well, after he reordered a 1/2 size up.  The shoes run a little small.  He normally wears a size 11.  They had to be exchanged for an 11 1/2.  It’s a well made shoe.

It's a quality shoe, I'll give it that. Can't go wrong with Nike, but it's not as comfortable as I was hoping from reviews. I stand and walk on hard concrete floors 9 hours a day, very little relaxing. By the end of my day my knees are killing me, and my feet ache. Well, my old shoes were ok for that, made a heck of a difference with dr shoals insoles. But these shoes don't feel any better, they might actually be a bit more uncomfortable at days end. The white sole is also filthy after only a week walking around, so not the best for a dirty environment, but what shoe is... At least their new and free of holes.😊

I needed some new walking shoes and something for the spring/summer season. These fit my feet perfectly. I love the material that stretches around the toes.

Okay these are my favorite sneakers but the pair I just received are deformed. If you look at the right tip of sneaker it’s mis-colored but it’s an overuse of or spill over of glue. Now I’m stuck with them so be careful ordering online.

I was immediately surprised at how light weight these are. It was like putting on air. Really well ventilated too. And the comfort Is great it's like I could sleep with these. Not in a weird fetish way but just like I could fall asleep while still wearing them on my feet is what I mean.

Probably the most COMFORTABLE sneakers I've ever worn. We were making fun of them in the store calling them ""moon shoes', but then I put my feet in them and my face dropped. I went right to checkout and bought them. They are sneakers but feel even more comfortable than slippers. There are no hard seems on them so they fit evenly around your foot with no pressure points. I have a wide foot and these adapted perfectly. I came right on Amazon to buy a second pair. I might even buy a third and hang on to them.

I wear them for running and they feel very comfortable. For the price they are very worth it. It is very bare bones so know that going in.

Thats it.

After just a few runs, I’m already wearing down the tread greatly. This is probably best suited for indoor running and exercises and not any outdoor use. The shoe breathes well and has a snug fit I was wanting, but it seems to be breaking down after only 3 weeks, and I’m alternating shoes with workouts as well.

These shoes were great and very comfortable, however they only lasted 5 months before a hole appeared in the top of the shoe. Additionally, the netting at the front of the shoe began to come loose from the rubber sole at the tip of the shoe. Pretty disappointing, as these shoes are very lightweight and comfortable. For reference, I wore them to the gym (2-3x a week) and whenever doing any time of physical activity outside.

I bought this shoe because it was listed as one of the top shoes to buy for people on their feet all day, plus some of the reviews here said it's a great shoe for that purpose. I work in a warehouse, ten hour shifts. I spent a lot of money, expecting that these shoes would deliver. By the time I get home from work every day, I can barely walk anymore, so I was hoping to find a pair of shoes that would alleviate my foot pain. I wore these the first day and was disappointed that they did not deliver like so many other people said. After only a few hours on my feet, I was back to being in pain and found no difference from wearing these shoes than any other shoe.

I have flat feet, and finding a comfortable walking/running shoe is extremely difficult.  My job requires a LOT of walking several hours a day, and these feel like I’m wearing socks!  Incredibly soft and comfortable, and I can walk all day in my flat feet.  I was so impressed with these that after just 3 days I ordered another pair in a different color.If you have flat feet like me, you will absolutely LOVE these!

The toe box is really tight and the fit is a bit narrow. The shoes seemed comfortable but I did not do more than try them on before I decided to return them. If you have narrow feet these shoes should be good for you.

I bought these on sale and I loved them when I got them but they were a bit too small, too painful to wear. I wear 9.5 mens in other Nikes so I figured all their shoes run the same...they don't. I wish I could return for a bigger size but the price had more than doubled since I bought them so I just got a refund which was very quick (thank you amazon) I had a refund in my account a few minutes after I dropped them off at UPS store. If buying get a size bigger for sure! maybe a size and half to be safe. Cool shoes though, seemed comfortable and added height.

I have a big foot (size 11 women's shoe).  I purchased the black pair in a men's size 10, they are alittle bit wider in the toe area whereas a women's shoe fits tight and a wide is too wide.  Very comfortable so I found these online and ordered them in white.

I absolutely love these shoes. Man are they comfortable. Probably the most comfortable shoes I’ve ever owned. This was the second pair I bought. BUT I keep having the same issues with them. After 3-4 months a hole always appears in the area where my big toes are. I saw another review just now talking about the same thing. I got them for $40 and I see they’ve gone up to almost $100. I didn’t mind buying a second pair because of the price, but for $100 I would never. Not for the poor quality.

My new favorite pair of shoes. Got these for 55 on Friday and they were at my door on Sunday. I'm pretty sure these are the casual/walking shoes I'll be wearing from now on. I'll save my Air Force Ones for those special occasions. They also give you a good amount of lift. Super clean black, I'm just hoping I don't get the white part dirty too quickly

The shoe itself is comfortable and fits fine, however the traction faded within months. If it rains you literally can't wear these shoes or you'll feel like your walking on ice slipping around everywhere. Such a huge disappointment  esp for a nike shoe at the 100 dollar price point.

Love these shoes for daily use. Comfy. Goes with anything. Just wish the fabric cover over the insert was glued into place better. Mine started to slowly loosen up until it came out completely.

These shoes are not the best looking, but they are so very comfortable. I have achilles tendinosis, and walking is extremely painful.

These are nice shoes! I will say from past experience, that Nike shoe sizes do run small. I normally wear a 10 1/2, but with Nike I wear an 11 1/2. I bought 11 1/2 and they fit perfectly and they are very comfortable. Hard to find basic black and white shoes anymore. Everything is either neon orange or some other crazy color. I do recommend these shoes though. Just be carefull about the size you order.

These were kind of narrow and hurt my feet until like the 6th time I wore them...

When I first put these on they were a bit tight but figured they'd stretch a bit.  They did not, while they were ok in the toe area, the width was very snug.  My main issue with the shoe was that for all the apparent cushioning, there is actually very little once you put them on.  It is a very, very firm shoe with little to no arch support, I could feel myself standing on my heals.The mesh of the upper is very nice and does ventilate well.  If you will be doing a reasonable amount of standing or walking, these are not the shoes to wear.  I wear a standard width size 10 for the last 30+ years, these are on the snug side.

I ordered a pair of these size 8 wide. What came were a used pair, size 8. The box wasn’t new and said size 8. The person who put stickers on the box covering where it’s marked size 8 with stickers that say say size 8 wide. The sneakers I paid for were supposed to be brand new. They weren’t. The left sneaker was incorrectly relaced. The bottom of the sneaker was worn down. For the money I paid I expect, no I demand brand new, quality product, not sneakily refurbished trash.

The shoes I purchased were marketed and bought under the label and description that they were men’s shoes.  I got them and jammed them on my feet and they’ve crushed my feet.  At first I thought I just needed to break them in but realized they are not men’s as I had been promised as those I purchased.  I have 3 pair of these in men’s and they are as comfortable as anything so I knew something wasn’t right.  I would like my money back please and/or possible, they be replaced with a size 10.5 men’s version of these sneakers.  Very upsetting.

I'm really disappointed with the quality that amazon is supporting. I got this pair of shoes in january 2018. The net of the shoes was torn in 2 months !!!

The second pair literally tore in January again!!! I'm extremely disappointed with either very cheap quality products unintentionally getting mixed with the good lot or an intentional manifestation of extremely poor quality products under high prices distributed by amazon.

I've done and am still doing research on shoes. I have plantar fasciitis and need a cushioned shoe. This is definitely not it. I'm not sure what's going on with the reviews and/or the claims by the company, but these shoes have a cheap 2mm foam insert on top of an extremely hard outsole. This thing does not give at all. I tried these shoes on for 15 minutes and couldn't stand the pain.These may be great for stability, I don't know. They're definitely not comfortable or cushioned at all.

Tanjun are the worst sneaker so far in Nike history in my household . Bought them july 11th and they are in the trash already. Poorly made wore out the tread already plus the side of the shoe material got a stretched shredded spot in the material . Not the toe part in the ankle area.  Money wasted.

I had these shoes for less than a month.  I put 48 walking miles on them at which time there was not any tread on the sole.  Either the shoes were defective, used because there was hardly any tread when I received them or a knock off.  Never buy shoes online from this  vendor or Amazon.

These sneakers developed a one to two inch tear where the fabric meets the sole of the shoe. This happened after less than six months of use. Very cheaply made, extremely disappointed in Nike.

I have NO idea how it got so many 5 stars. Probably from sponsors, paid people or amateur sneakerheads. The quality is of a sweat factory that costs $1.50 for sale to make. It's an absolute rip off and the gums are too high. Go to the mall and buy a better quality pair. Not even the outlets have it this bad. Clearance product.

For everyone saying that the tag and sole are different it’s because of Nikes “Switch to Zero” project so it’s the same shoe just with a different design on tag and sole.

I bought a pair of black Nike Tanjuns recently after liking a couple of previous pairs of the same style.  The latest pair is essentially the same design as in the past but seems a bit heavier and stiffer to me.  I like these shoes for being lightweight, flexible and comfortable.  So the latest pair is not quite as nice as previous, possibly due to a somewhat different upper fabric.  It's important to know that the moderate texture of the sole wears down pretty quickly, and the fabric can start to wear through at the toe in particular.  But for a lightweight shoe with no expectation of being solid or durable, that's a trade-off I've been willing to make.  I have a narrow foot, and these are among the few walking shoes I've found that hold to my feet, not too roomy so that my feet don't move around but still comfortable.  I notice that the price just went down dramatically from the last time I checked, so I wonder what accounts for the drastic price variation lately--supply issues?

I've purchased several pairs of these. That is a good thing and a bad thing.On the good, they're barely noticeable on your feet. They keep your feet very cool on hot days. They're flexible and just overall enjoyable an unnoticeable when worn. The mesh top seems like it would rip. But I've had it hold up to quite the beating.On the bad, they usually last a year. They had very poor tread even new. They wear quite quickly even so. They're certainly not winter shoes.It is a give an take. These are my go to casual summer shoes. If you wore these to a fast food job, you'd be in for some trouble. But in the right context, they're very nice. I've tried many ""breathable"" shoes like these and they they don't remotely compare to these.

Four stars here for comfort and relaxed style that looks good with many outfits.  I wore them on a plane and loved it.. super easy to get on/off without untying the laces, and it feels like you're walking on air.  Perfect airport shoe.However, I will say that this shoe is NOT appropriate for any kind of fitness activity.  There is very little structure to the shoe; it basically fits and feels like a slipper rather than an athletic shoe.  The mesh is very soft and has a lot of give, so they are not safe for running.

I walk about 150 miles per month. I go through a lot of shoes, usually a pair every 3 months or so.There is a normal break-in period for shoes, where your feet get used to the little seams and nubs inside the shoe, and the feel of the padding, etc. That's just how it is with shoes.But not THESE shoes. I put them on and went on a 10-mile hike. No blisters, no sore spots - NADA. They are easily the most comfortable shoes I have ever owned, period. The soles are flexible enough that when you step on something that isn't quite flat, you get a good grip on it. The mesh breathes so that your feet don't get hot or sweaty. The sides are flexible so that your feet don't get too constricted.The only thing that might be less desirable about them is that the bottoms appear to be wearing pretty rapidly. I am wearing them outside, but I think maybe they are designed to be used indoors (basketball shoes?) I got them on sale at a big-box store in a bargain bin, so I don't have any of the packaging.

Black Anthracite-Black, size 14M: These fit me very well. I can wear them for 16 hours if needed - usually 10-12 for sure. And they look great. I get away with wearing them to semi-formal business meetings; the Black on Black meansthat nobody appears to look at them, in this case a big plus (I try and dazzle them with my looks and charming personality so they don't stare at my feet, ha). At formal occasions with receptions, I wear leather shoes to the ceremony and then switch into these for the reception. Too kewl.All that said, the soles wear out pretty quickly. I get 2 to 2 1/2 months on them at most, and if I keep wearing them I will slip on wet surfaces, including sidewalks outdoors. So beware of that. But for a little over $30/month, with everyday wear, these are acceptably priced. Nike should, however, do something about these soles. which is why 3 stars.

I have purchased two pairs of these shoes and pretty much know what to expect.  These are good for comfortable all day wearing with few other frills.  If it rains or snows, these leak immediately since they are a mesh upper.  Also, don't buy these for works hoes if you are working with heavy weight or on slick surfaces.  The sole texturing wears out rather quickly, especially if like me you wear them while pulling 1000+ pound pallets on a concrete surface. On ice, or wet floors (both linoleum tile and polished concrete), these shoes are actively dangerous; both of my pairs gave little traction in these situations.For working out or gym use, they are merely adequate.  There are both better and much worse for this use case, but with Nike you often end up paying for ""premium"" pairs.

I use these shoes for work, I usually walk about 13 miles per day at work. They feel great on my feel, but on the smooth surfaces of a warehouse floor they tend to be slick. I am sure they would be great for running. Also for whatever reason my right shoe developed a hole in the upper toe box in the mesh fabric.

First off let me start by saying these shoes are amazingly comfortable for all day working/walking! If you use these for running make sure to do a lace lock to improve ankle support. I absolutely love my Nike Tanjun's! I got the wolf Grey pair and I love them!

This shoe is nice to look at but the quality of the material is very low.The bottom is not made of rubber, but instead made of foam so it wears out really quickly. It's also incredibly thin at the bottom so there is no cushioning for your feet. It felt like walking barefoot but not in the good way.The toebox and front of the shoe is incredibly tight and small, and the sides wear out fast because of this. The ridiculously thin insoles are not replaceable as they are glued on to the shoes. If you try to add insoles on top of them, your foot will be squeezing into the shoe and the shoe will rip and tear soon after.Don't waste your money on these shoes. Either spend a bit of extra money on some better quality Nike shoes, or look elsewhere entirely.

The toe area is too snug. Also, I've ALWAYS worn size 10 in Nike. These 10's don't seem quite long enough.

The toe area of this shoe is way too narrow. The top of the shoe presses down in an uncomfortable way on the big toe. Only buy this shoe if you have narrow feet and super flat toes.

The shoes fit great and are comfortable, they just don't wear well.  I've had them for two months and wear them everyday and the tread on the soles are about gone. Two months is unacceptable. normally, my Nikes last about a year. If I wear them in the rain or on damp grass, my feet get wet.

I seem to have problems with my feet and with heart issues was asked by my doctor to walk every day. Bought the Royal Blue first pair of Nike.

Trust me these are the most comfortable pair of walking shoes I have had. If you look for comfort you will pick these.

I ordered these shoes to wear with my scrubs at work and they looked good for what I needed them for. However, you definitely get what you pay for. These are definitely your cheap Nike (outlet type) quality. If you are looking for a cheap shoe to get the shoe done though (like I was) they do the job! I highly do not suggest these for working out or if you will be on your feet a lot.

I ordered a 10.5, when I typically wear a 10 and it is still a bit narrow.  I wouldn't go up another half size so I just usually wear these with compression socks, which makes them fit fine - Comfortable and they look great!

I bought these shoes for an autistic 18 year old young man. He had a pair just like them same shoe. I bought him a different brand of new shoes and he would not wear them. He had been wearing his old shoes for almost 2 years. They really held up good. So I bought him a new pair. The shoes fit just like the old ones. Good width, toebox and arch support. He likes them a lot.

Not true to size for my husband.  He usually wears a 10 1/2 and I purchased that size and his toes are touching the front.  We will be exchanging them if I can figure out how. It’s a great show and no problem with the seller.  Just need a bigger size.

These shoes are extremely light and stretchy. The tops are a light mesh that stretch to fit without being too loose nor too tight. I have a bunion on my right foot and while you can actually see the bunion stretching the shoe, it doesn’t feel tight or constricting. I ordered this color, because it was by far the cheapest version, but it is actually quite attractive. Good deal on a comfortable shoe.

even though these are essentially 99% identical to Air Force Ones, the sole is noticably thinner and lacks the solid feel of AF1s which translates into hurting feet after a short time.

The sneaker itself looks very nice, but I send it back since because of Amazon's fault. On the chart listed on the webpage, it says UK Size 12 is EU 45 but in reality it is EU 46.

I received a pair of NikeReact Infinity Run Flyknit 3 with the following issues: (1) laces that are too short/cut, and clearly not the same as the pairs of Nike flyknits I've owned before, (2) a rip at the tongue on one of the shoes, and (3) and this is by far the worse, TWO LEFT SHOES.I am actually at a loss for words. This is appalling and should not be taken lightly. Extremely sketchy on the seller and Amazon. I will never be buying shoes from either party again.

I am a runner averaging 80 - 100 Km per week, all of which are relatively at an easy pace if I don't have an event specific training regime. It is my first time I get this kind of shoes. Nike recommends these shoes for long easy miles. I was a bit skeptical at the beginning but after 80Km on the shoes I can tell you that these are the Nike shoes for long and easy runs. They are very forgiving and you understand their value on your feet after the 16Km of the run. You feel like you run on a platform that supports your structure. They are very stable; very difficult to make a mistake and end up injured. For paces between (4:40 - 7:00)/Km and even slower they are great.For faster paces they are not the best choice because they are very stable and not very light. For the pace range I mentioned above you will be able to cruise for hours.They are not the Holly Grail of running. There is no such thing in running. You will get a runner's knee, for example, if you overdo it. But with these shoes this is the only thing I can see that may happen in normal running circumstances to recreational runners. Personally, the pricing of this seller for the particular shoes make them the best Nike choice for long easy runs.

Once upon a time, the Nike Air Max Plus was a good running shoe: comfortable, well-made and durable.  Unfortunately, that is not the case anymore, sorry to say.  Even though it's very comfortable, this particular model is more for show than performance.  After a meager 70 miles on the Air Max Plus, the tread on both shoes was worn in the same spot.  In addition, on one foot, the rear heel was peeling from wear.  I estimate that I may only get 200-250 miles out of a running shoe that cost $140.00.I am an outdoor runner and have been using Nike Air Max products for many years.  I have owned many prior versions that didn't feel as cheaply made or hard on the feet when running.  The Nike Air Max Plus is just not good at all for athletic performance, even though they look good on the feet. Even the Air Max 95 that I use for running in the rain feel more solid and well-built than the Air Max Plus....I'm afraid that Nike has lost all sight of manufacturing a quality, affordable running shoe and retaining brand loyalty.  Some of their other models range from $180-200 per pair and I would venture to guess that the performance is not proportionate to the price. After my experience with this pair, I am destined to look for another manufacturer that cares about the performance and quality of the products that it makes.

If you tend to stand for a prolonged period of time during your day, your feet will certainly thank you for having a comfortable padding on and these shoes offer comfort and style.

They are superfly! I have one complaint. They have used a very tender, old-school, canvas-colored soft suede as the toe protector, so they are tender and can get dirty instantly. I recommend a waterproof spray suede protector applied to the toe before actually using this shoe for ""what it originally designed"". I knew they would probably be tender, but I take care of my shoes.Great price for 2022 Nike Air Max Pre-Day's  which normally run $150+

This is my third pair of Nike men's Air Cross Trainers. Pete Carroll, the football coach for the Seahawks wears these. Seeing him running up and down the sidelines reminded me that my 2nd pair were worn and beginning to smell. The nearest place to buy them is 35 miles away, so, naturally, I thought of Amazon. I could purchase these for a better price and have them delivered to my door for free thru Prime.They're great shoes. I put at least ten miles a week on them thru walking, jogging and mowing the lawn. They are comfortable, absorb the impact of my feet hitting the ground, support my ankles and they look great. I have many pairs of shoes, but these are my go to for physical activity. Highly recommended!

I buy this model of Nike a couple of times a year through different sources and I try to get the best price on them as it will fluctuate as much as $40 depending on the seller and the color and the day.

I’m an older gentleman so I don’t run at all (if I can help it). I do put in 6 to 8 miles a day with my ~2-year old German Shepherd. Size 10 is perfect for me (width is good) and the leather is easy to clean. I will add once they get wet, don’t plan on sneaking up on anyone as they definitely “squeak”. Overall, for the price, I am very satisfied with these shoes. Your mileage may vary . . .

I began wearing Nike Air Monarchs years ago because of the wide fit. These are very comfortable for me.
",5,happy
"
I bought these for basketball because it seems that no shoe manufacturer makes specifically wide widths in basketball shoes, much less any width that even comes close to fitting my Fred Flintstone feet. And running shoes don't provide the support I apparently need. I tried the ""wide"" basketball shoes recommended by various websites (LeBrons, TMacs, Dames, etc.) but it was like trying to put my 6-year-old's shoes on. To be fair, I haven't tried New Balance's bball shoes--they don't come in wide widths specifically, but NB tends to run wider overall. However, I could not bring myself to wear a shoe whose design looks like it was stolen from a billboard in the background of any random scene in Blade Runner.The Monarchs are comfortable with excellent cushioning. I normally wear a 4E in New Balance and Clarks, and a wide in Keens, and the width on these works very well for me, which is the most important feature for me. Overall, I find they're quite...padded, for lack of a better word--especially in the tongue and upper. So they might require a tiny bit of breaking in.My only complaint is that the insole is very thin and I'm not sure if it's intended to be removed. I did remove it to check, and I could tell that I was separating a layer of weak adhesive; the insoles came out perfectly intact, though, and I have since reinstalled them with no issues. I normally would wear a custom orthotic with these, but it seems like it might be a tight squeeze. I haven't tried that yet, as my orthotics are pretty rigid, and it's clear that being away from the court for 10 years has had an effect on my knees that the cushioning helps mitigate.And OK, yes: These are the quintessential dad shoes. There's no getting around that. But I'm a middle-aged dad who's not playing ball with a bunch of teenagers. I also don't really care that much what other people think of something that has absolutely nothing to do with them. So the math on that is fairly easy to do. Admittedly, though, I bought the all-black version and added a set of blue laces, which sort of (?) begins to maybe make them look slightly cooler. I'm very happy with my purchase, overall.

Love the shoes but cannot get anyone to help me on issue from my shoes.  About the forth time I wore them, I noticed a  loud squeak in my right heal.  It is a faulty air cushion in the heal that makes the noise and has popped.  I only wore them to the gym and have not worn them since.  I just wanted a replacement and can not get anyone to help with that process.  I love the shoes and they are unbelievable comfortable.  I may have to eat the cost of these shoes and buy another pair.  Any suggestions to get these replaced, please let me know.  Amazon has always been top notch when it comes to these kinds of issue.

I don’t purchase Nike, usually.  I’m a painter and the job I was working entailed a lot of wood replacement on the house roof trim. I’ve had problems with my feet since neck surgery. The pitch of the roof and the concrete around the house was exhausting to walk on and day after day, my pain increased, until I decided I needed a new pair of shoes. I tried on every brand in my size (12) and found these to be extremely well fit! I liked them so much, I immediately bought a second pair because of limited availability. I use these shoes for work specifically to help with land variations and different elevations. I recommend these to anyone but especially to those needing extra comfort and support.

Everyone knows this is one of the most comfortable shoes Nike makes. It has a reputation of being a “dad shoe” but I’m not sure if that matters these days with “dad shoes” being quite popular. The only negative for me is that I take a size 16 in most Nike and this shoe only runs up to a 15. Given that they have the option of buying it in a wider option, I am able to make due with the 15 but a 16 would still be preferable. That aside, I do also really love the look of this shoe in the black and white with hints of red colorway. I give the shoes 5 stars but I gave it 4 stars for the gym as you are not going to squat, deadlift or run in them. Great for doing back, chest, arms shoulders or light cardio though.

After having worn these for just shy of a year, as others have experienced, the rubber outsole began separating from the shoe at the toe. My left shoe completely separated from the toebox (if I lifted up my foot, the outsole would droop down), meanwhile the right shoe has started to separate at the toe. Wouldn't recommend this shoe as a daily driver, but more like an inexpensive ""show"" piece, where they get used maybe 1 or 2 times a week or don't get exposed to the elements. Otherwise, you'll be lucky if they make it past 8 months.Comfort/Fit: 9/10 -- Offered great arch support, plenty of cushion for my daily dog walks, and did a pretty good job at keeping my feet dry when treading through wet grass. They're also semi breathable, so my feet didn't get ridiculously sweaty during warm mornings. Above all else, they fit my high-arched, wide feet really well (9.5 4E). No complaints in the fit in length or width (as expected/comparable to brands -- if anything, runs about a 1/4 size longer than a Nike 9.5 4E, but not enough to warrant a smaller size).Design/Materials: 2/10 -- The quarter package (inner shoe padding), the insole, and the stitching have held up great to repeated usage (no problems there); however, the materials/glue used on the outside of the boot are super cheap and prematurely break down. For example, when the outsole was coming off of the left boot, I was able to fix it by using a ton of E6000 glue (I first used Shoe Goo and that did not work and separated within a week -- I also had to use quite a bit more E6000 glue than I wanted, but I needed to make sure the bond between the outsole and shoe was sealed off from water/debris). Unfortunately, I also used some semi-sticky tape to hold everything together/in place while waiting for the glue to congeal. After about 48hrs, I took off the tape, and with it came chunks of the paper-thin pleather. Now my shoe looks like it has a really bad sun-burn where the pleather has bubbled/curled up and/or peeled away from the shoe. Despite the shoe looking like Frankenstein, the E6000 glue has held up long enough for me to purchase a different pair of shoes. If it weren't for the cheap manufacturing glue or lack of glue, none of this should have been an issue.Overall: 5/10 -- the shoe holds up fine as long as you don't wear it outside too often (in door use is ideal, as I have another pair that I strictly use for work and that pair has held up fine over the same time span - a year). If you're looking for a cheap shoe to use and abuse and don't expect it to last for more than a year, get these, otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere.

These are the only shoes that my husband will wear. We have to buy 2 at a time just so that he can have one on hand when he wears the other pair out as he tends to walk on the side of his foot. These help with that and he doesn't have the back or knee bad like he did in other shoes due to the way he walks. And the fact that you can easily find them in an 4E wide it's a win win for us.

These shoes are comfortable and fit as expected. I use them for everyday use at home and at work. However,  these are the loudest squeaking shoes I have ever heard. It does not matter if I walk on carpet, tile, grass, or any surface. They are extremely squeaky. I have had these shoes for 4 months and thought the noise would go away but hasnt. The noise is so loud that it draw the attention of everyone. Very embarrassing. This is why I rate these shoes as an overall 2 stars. I will not order these again because of the noise and have stopped wearing them.

As of 02/11/2015 I have owned these Nike Monarchs for approximately one month so far.  The intended sole purpose of this purchase is the need of a pair of comfortable walking shoes, for my job as a city meter reader and after work activities.  And in this area the Monarchs really excels, its like I'm walking on air and my feet thanks me for it each work day.  The only con so far is like other reviewers have already stated that the Monarchs do squeek; and its quite embarrassing.(yes i'm aware of the solutions to remedy this flaw).  In the durability area, the monarchs are still in the testing phase; but so far I dont have any stitching fail or other problems so far.  Mind you, you have to know that in my work environment I literary walk non-stop for a eight hour shift in all types of abrasive environments rain or shine.  Typically I usually expect to have my shoes replaced in a two to three month period, so hopefully I get my money's worth out of these puppies.  I will post updates for the next two months and convey further my thoughts on this product.  Thank you05/23/2015 update: Sadly at the two month mark of ownership, my Nike Monarchs failed.  The left shoe blew a seam and my right shoe the uppers separated from the outsole near the toe area by two inches in length. (Mind you I walk an average of 6-9 miles per workday). But from the get go these Monarchs were the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn, If only nike fixes the squeak issues and tweak up the durability I would wholeheartedly recommend these shoes to any utilities meter reader and/or postal service worker.  So I will minus one more star for the durability aspect of these shoes.

This is the 3rd pair of these shoes I've owned. For me they've lasted a long time. On a fishing trip I left the first pair I had bought at Dick's Sporting Goods at the boat ramp after having changed into my kayak shoes. These had lasted a year and were still going strong. Bought a second pair and they've held up 2 years. I could have probably got another 6 months out of them but decided to buy new again, and use the old ones for wading in the water as they're still durable. The only problem I had with the first 2 pairs were that they squeaked loudly every time you took a step. Seems they've fixed this problem with the pair I just got, and the shoe laces are easier to stay tied. I always needed to double tie before. Also these are a little tighter. I have a wide foot and it's good that I ordered a size 11. Still tighter than my old pair at 10 1/2. Keep my fingers crossed that a squeak won't develop again. Still the only shoe I've found that lasts and fits me well.

At first, the blue trim and swoosh seemed a bit too fancy and conspicuous for a middle-class suburban dad, but I had to pick something new when Reebok stopped selling the DMX Max.

I’ve had 3 pairs of these now.  I got fat wide size 13 shoe size.  I used to get Scetchers they fit well and I loved the way they looked but they fall apart quickly as do Newbalane.  This Nike’s last.  In the late 90s Nike made nothing in my size 13 and wide so I was reluctant to order and I hadn’t owned white shoes in over 20 years but the value and fell and durability are outstanding.  All these pairs of shoes have looked the same so I hope they come up with some different looks before the next time I order these shoes.—-Update 12/2020.  I still really like these shoes but they have been lasting less and less time.  My 3rd, most recent, shoe got a hole in it a few months ago.  It lasted about 9 months.  My 1st pair lasted the longest.  They looked ugly when I retired them.  My 2nd pair lasted about 1 year.  Now that pair still looked good but the tread was almost gone.

I've had several pairs of these and don't wear them all the time by any means. These are now about three years old and still look in great shape. However, last year they started squeaking, one more than the other. And it has gotten worse. None of my previous pairs has squeaked. I see fixes (baby powder or similar under the sole), but why should that even be necessary. Something changed in their manufacture and it is exceedingly irritating to both myself and others whom I pass in halls. The shoe historically has been great, but I am no longer sure I would purchase another pair - which is too bad when you think you have a good thing going!

This is the second pair of these shoes I have purchased at a far lower price then currently priced today.  However, even at the full retail cost these are an excellent buy.  I have always bought New Balance 609 cross walkers which have been discontinued and this shoe has copied.  The reason for my purchase is I noticed many men wearing the shoe, some with orthopedic problems in which they feel helps them.These shoes are well built and very comfortable which come in many sizes and widths.  Both of my white shoes were purchased from Amazon for they had the best price at that time!  Fortunately, they were made in Indonesia for I am adverse at anything made in China.I have pes planus (flat feet) and falling arches which followed.  These above shoes have great support with 6 eyelets and firm outer leather construction to allow one good mobility to function. The base platform is somewhat pliable and not too rigid.  The wearer will notice a marked improvement in their posture, walking ability, and reduction of stress on their skeletal structure.  I will continue to purchase this shoe.

I walked my previous shoes into the ground, and my year-long efforts to find shoes in stores have all failed.  For example, I went to a large sports store that said that they had 100 different shoes in my size ...but only one pair in the whole store that was just plain black, and that one pair was horribly uncomfortable.  Eventually, I decided that I needed some new ones right away, even if they weren't perfect, so I decided to order the same thing again.  It's a slightly different model from my previous Nike Air Monarchs, but as soon as I put it on, I remembered:  Oh, yeah, when the old pair was new, I decided that they were kind of okay, but that I'd definitely get a different kind next time.They're stiff and something about them pinches just the smallest toes.  I feel like my foot is actually in the shoe a little crooked, as if the insole were glued in about 10 degrees off from straight, so that the one toe gets smashed into the outer side of the shoe, but the biggest toe barely touches the inner side, and my heel is off center in the other direction.  My foot seems to slide forward when I walk, which makes the pinched-toe problem worse.  It might be slightly too narrow at the ball of the foot, and it's much too wide at the heel.  If I'd tried these on in the store, they would have gone right back in the box.  But since I couldn't just pull a different kind off the shelf, and since the price was relatively low (under $50), and since I needed a pair of shoes now, I decided to keep them.  They're a little better overall than the used pair, and maybe next month I'll try to find another shoe store.

My one complaint is that the sole wears down fairly quickly. I tend to walk 70,000+ steps every week, so I give the shoes a workout. The hold up well, except for the sole. I'm lucky if I can get the sole to last 6 months before I need to replace them.  I will say most other shoes I have tried have a similar issue.

I've had this shoe before and it was the most comfortable pair I had. I just recently got another pair and I'm glad I came back to them. I'm a medical student and walking around on the hard hospital floor all day combined with having extremely flat feet has resulted in pretty bad plantar faciitis in my left foot with accompanying Achilles' tendon irritation and ankle swelling from over probation. I've only worn these shoes for a few weeks, but so far they're working better than any shoe I've tried as far as having a good balance between comfort and structural support. I gave a 4 star rating instead of 5 for two reasons mainly...1)  The lateral part of the inner toe box seems to be rubbing against my left pinky toe, causing some irritation. It's annoying but even if I can't fix it, it's still worth it considering how much the shoe has helped my flat feet problems. 2) These shoes are popular sellers mainly because of their comfortability but that still hasn't influenced Nike to create a better design or color scheme for them. Comfort is my primary concern but I don't know why these have to look like old man shoes lol. I think something like a gray swoop on the black version would go a long way. Either way it's a great shoe if you're looking for comfort and structural support for an affordable price.

This shoe provides extremely good cushioning of the heel and sole and provides great support.  The vinyl/leather upper allows the shoe to hold snugly without the need for frequent re-tying.  For me, it holds its fit much better than a mesh upper.  As a result of the great fit, cushioning, and support, my plantar fasciitis symptoms began to disappear only a few days after I started wearing these shoes around the house all day.The shoe really looks great too.  I bought the white version that has a large silvery Nike swoosh on each side and black accents in various locations.  It's a more adult look than the wild colors favored by teens.  I've had this shoe before, and I know from experience that it cleans up really well and retains a like-new look for a long time.The only caution is that this shoe doesn't breathe like a shoe with a mesh upper, so they can make your feet hot if they stay on too long in a warm room.  But this is just part of the standard trade-off between a less-sturdy and quickly dirty mesh shoe compared to a less breathable solid upper.  For me, I wear this shoe almost all day, but I switch to a cooler mesh shoe for my work-outs at the gym.By the way, the black version of this shoe is a comfortable thing to wear to work for places that permit casual attire.

My husband is a home inspector.He needs to look professional, clean and presentable to our clients,  while walking through muddy lots, rain and snow, climbing on ladders, crawling through muddy crawlpaces, etc. He needs solid black shoes (with no outer fabric) that can easily be brushed/wiped off and look clean again for his next appointment. He's on his feet for 9-12 hours a day, so comfort and durability is also important!  He's tried many black sneakers and always complains about his feet hurting.  He goes through 2 or 3 pairs a year, so he's had plenty of opportunities to try new shoes every few months.  After 6 years of trying them all THIS is the pair/brand he has finally settled on, and I have reordered them at least 3 times now.  (None of the others got a 2nd chance.) He never complains about his feet hurting anymore, and these are so easy to brush and wipe off to look good again after a messy job. (If they get scuffed, I can touch them up with that dab on black shoe paint, but I've never actually had to do that.)  It's taken us years to find ""the shoe"".  My only problem now is getting him to NOT wear them when we go out! (I mean, come on, they're plain black sneakers.)

When I first put these shoes on, wow, it felt wonderful! Like I put them into a soft pillow. They are very comfortable and very easy on your feet (I walk 40 or more hours a week on these). I love them!! However, after 4 months of use, one of them is squeaking.  I've looked at many reasons for squeaky sneakers and I can't find one that fits. Maybe mine had a factory weak spot. I wish I could have them replaced to see if this happens again, but there's no option to return after 4 months. Try them at your own risk--perhaps I walk too much. ;)

I've had six pairs of Nike Air Monarch's-- obviously I like them.  I need a comfy pair of shoes for work and just walking around NYC where I average 9000 steps a day.  I ordered a new pair of red and black Air Monarchs size 8 extra wide because I need a large toe box.  But these fit differently-- my toes touch the front and are squeezed into the toe box.

I have a size 12 of these Nike's and 11.5 of some new balance.  I have no idea why but the front of these sneakers is WAY too narrow.

While these are fairly comfortable, the width seems too narrow (extra wides).  One pair I have had the side rip near the small toe long before the rest of the shoe wore.Also, the fronts detach from the rest of the shoe long before the rest of the shoe wears.  This has happened on several ones that I bought.  Tried repairing with shoe goo stuff but that doesn't hold for very long.

The shoes are deceptively not-wide. There's a lot of external material that makes them look chunkier than they truly are, and ""perfect"" for people with wider feet, but it's all for show. The sole is bulky which is good, but you're standing on a thick platform which is bad, so it feels fine for short-burst walking, but I will never recommend these for running, or standing for long periods of time, specially if your feet are flat and wide like mine.The shoes barely have any give to them, and the chunky sole stretches the material on top, which makes the shoe fit tight regardless of how much you loosen the shoelaces. There's no toe-room because the wider part of the shoe is somehow where the arch of your foot is, which is either bad-design, or poor quality control because usually, people have wide toes, not wide arches, but maybe it's just my feet.Overall, I will never recommend these shoes, specially for the price.

For the second time in the last year I have had UPS deliver a package to the wrong address.  In both cases the items were properly addressed and labelled. but for reasons known only to the driver, the deliveries were made to houses down the street.  In the first case the house was obviouly vacant but under renovation.  The only reason I actually got the item was that I saw a box looking like the one I was expecting, fortunately a little outside the ordinary, and went up to check the label just as one of the workman came out and spotted the delivery.  I was able to claim the item based on my name and address, and while I would like to think that the individual would have gotten it to me anyway, who knows.  With this latest item, I was fortunate that the delivery went to a friends house across the street and down the block.  As soon as she saw my name and address she gave me a call and I was able to go over and pick it up. I don't know what is going on with UPS, but it makes me very vigilant if they are supposed to be delivering anything to me and I will not ship with them at this time.

I use my new Nikes exclusively in the gym.  They we're reasonably comfortable right out of the box.  I'm confident they'll improve with age.  I purchased them to replace a very old and heavy pair of New Balance 1007 trainers that have mesh in the toe area.  I'm pleased with how light my new Nikes are, but the lack of mesh ventilation makes them noticeably warmer.  They would probably be too warm for use as a running shoe.  I haven't had them long enough for them to start squeaking or for the outsole to separate as other reviewers have reported.  I have my talcum powder and shoe Goop handy for when they do.  They were only $40 and actually look pretty nice, so If they don't workout as a gym trainer they'll become street shoes.

This shoe is a shame. It’s really another great shoe from Nike. The problem is whenever and wherever you walk in these shoes it sounds like your slogging around in wet shoes  The problem began immediately after I wore them the fists time and It’s terribly annoying!!  I understand the problem is in the little air pockets that are incorporated into the sole if the shoe and that there is nothing that can be done about it except to ignore it..For me, it’s torture , I’m moving on to a new shoe without an air sole.

They are way nicer than I thought they would be. I mean, they feel cheap, but not ""cheap-cheap"" and rather ""cheap-and-durable"" kind of cheap. They look fantastic in this cool gray, white and green. Put in some hyper-crimson laces I had from a pair of Neutral Gray AJ1's I had laying around somewhere and that just took them to a whole new level. I will be buying another pair just to beat those up and keep these in my collection.As for the shoe fit itself. They fit good, they are very light, there is a phylon sole with just a bit of rubber and lots of air. It's no Air Max, boost or React, but this very basic construction of almost all phylon make you really feel that air unit. The leather feels cheap (it's fake), there is not much padding either, but that doesn't take any comfort away.Already took them out for a spin and I was surprised to get compliments for this cheap pair of $60 dad shoes. Great purchase.

I have purchased two or three pairs of these sneakers and while I really like the feel, comfort and support they give you, I am terribly disappointed in the squeaking sound they produce after a relatively short period of time. On ordering my last pair I figured I can't be the only one this is happening to and thought they would have eliminated the problem but after wearing my current pair for a couple of months, they are now squeaking also. Particularly when I walk on any kind of tile. This occurs whether in a home or commercial establishment with tile floors. At this point I would not recommend these sneakers unless they were only to be used for outside sporting type events or hiking.

I bought this shoe as a compromise, and as a compromise it worked very well.I was going to Europe for a couple months and traveling very light. I wanted a running shoe combined with a black leather walking shoe that I could stay in all day long and wear to the opera or a decent restaurant. In European cities, nothing screams “idiot American tourist” louder than wearing a pair of flashy “trainers” on the street.As a running shoe, the Monarch is heavy and stiff, but has the cushioning and stability to tackle Paris paving stones. My regular running shoes are Vibram five-fingered Spiridons, so the Monarch felt like a pair of combat boots until I got used to them, but they served well.As a dress shoe, they were all right. They are large and clunky, but at least they’re black leather with subdued trademarks.As a walking shoe, they’re great. The stiffness and cushioning are appreciated in cobblestone streets and forest paths. Since coming back to my apartment full of other footwear, I haven’t worn them once. They’re sitting in the suitcase waiting for another trip.The squeaking went away immediately with the talcum powder treatment recommended by other reviewers.

I work in retail and am on my feet for my entire shift of 8-10 hours. As I get older, comfort in a shoe is an absolute must. These shoes are very comfortable. They bend with the foot as you walk and are of a normal weight so they don't feel like bricks. They appear well made. Maybe Ill update this when they give out and report if anyone is interested. I'm nicking it a star for the following reason:The primary reason I thought to write a review is to warn everyone about the size ordering. As other reviews have warned you must order larger than you normally wear. My feet really only need a US 10 1/2  but I always buy 11 so my toes have lots of space. I ordered 11 in these and they feel like 10 1/2  My toes have little to no room to move and the tip is not squarish but sharply rounded stealing more toe space. Other than this I love these shoes so far. Im hoping as i break them in maybe the shoe will expand a little and give me my toe room I need. I will order these again but in 11 1/2 to be sure.

Wow! These actually fit without stretching out for a month first. I have very wide feet, I am usually only able to get Sketchers, or New Balance athletic shoes to fit comfortably. Back in the Day, when I was a Student Athlete, I used to get Puma Shot and Disk Shoes, Adidas Football Cleats, and everything else was NIke. All of the afore mentioned were uncomfortable and blister causing for weeks, even after being put on a shoe stretcher, yes reat shoe stores used to have that service, but my feet are actually a 4E, going form a D medium is a long stretch, and the machines didn't go that far. Recently when looking for my wife to get some red Nike's for her friday color days at work, I typed in men's 10.5. 4E and shoes actually were available from Amazon, this is my second pair I bought (and this was a great bargain as it was last years model $58) leather whites to alternate with my blue fabric running shoes (although I admit my running days are well behind me now).

I received these today. They immediately looked to me like cheap heavy-plastic fake Nikes. Are they real?I have a pair of very similar black real Nikes of almost the same style I've been wearing recently. I wanted to replace them because the soles are worn thin.These shoes are big and clunky. They're noticeably heavy, compared with other Nikes I've tried recently. They have visible sloppy glue around the soles on all sides. I put one one and the soles are very high and seem very hard. The fit didn't seem as comfortable as my Nikes I have already.Are these real Nikes? Does anyone know?I'm updating my review from 1 to 3 stars a week or two later. Although the glue on them is sloppy and they don't look that sharp, they do fit properly and seem comfortable in the general way I'm used to with real brand shoes.

Excellent fit and cushioning, with just the right amount arch support for me, and (increasingly rare these days) with the arch support located in the right place (i.e. not too far back toward the heel).  I'm a big guy (6'4"" 275) and I can be on my feet all day in these and come home without sore feet.  I've had bouts of plantar fascitis in the past, so I'm always mindful of cushioning and fit for shoes I'm going to be spending lots of time on my feet in, and these are just fantastic.  I like them so much I bought several pairs, in both the white/silver and black/white/red.  I especially like the black/white/red color scheme, super cool-looking.  Only one pair had the infamous squeak, and it went away after a few days of break-in.

The squeaking on these shoes are absolutely terrible, I knew they had a problem with squeaking before I bought them bit I thought it'd go away after wear and tear but no, I've had these for over a year and they still squeak like a chipmunk.It is absolutely embarrassing, they squeak every single step you take and I wish I never bought them, if anyone gets annoyed at things like that these aren't for you.

I keep a nice pair of dress shoes at work but these are my and “commuting to work” shoes since I still have to walk a few blocks each way whether I take public transportation or drive and park in the garage.It’s been several years since I bought my first pair so, this may be my 3rd or 4th(?) set.  They are comfortable enough for my commute and I also try to get a walk in at lunch so they get plenty of use.So far, I have had my last pair for a couple of years but bought this latest pair to start breaking them in before the old ones are retired to “not for work” status.  Both pair look pretty much the same so, I wear either one to work.These have worked very well for me.

I'm not a fan of some of corporate Nike's SJW stances but credit where it's due...these are well made, long-lasting, comfortable shoes and they're priced right.I bought my first pair of Nike Air Monarch Trainers about 15 years ago.  I still wear them.  They have been one of the most durable shoes I've ever worn.  But, they are showing some age.The new model feels much more stiff than I remember the originals feeling.  I'll probably have to wear them a week or so just to break them in.  May have to rub a little dirt on them, too, because...d**n, they're white.***NOTE***:  I have very wide feet and the standard width in this style fits me perfectly.  The original pair I bought were US10 size and that's what I bought to replace them.  They still fit my foot very well.  In everything else I wear a 9.5EE so I'd say they run a little wide and a little small.

About 10 years ago I started using New Balance sneakers which used to be very thick, durable and strong. However, New Balance have gotten cheaper and cheaper with each new model. The company (New Balance) has cut corners to save money. By doing so they have officially lost business with me and countless other former customers. Along comes Nike to the rescue.I first saw Nike Mens Air Monarch IV in a local store and was very impressed. This sneaker is very thick and strong which is necessary if you play sports or walk long distances. The Nike shoe is made like the old New Balance about 10 years ago. The top, bottom and inside is very thick and strong as it should be.I've used this Nike brand 6 times so far for working out (about 45 minutes to an hour each time). So far they look and feel great. I didn't hear any squeaking as mentioned by other reviewers. The first use did feel snug or a bit tight. After that it just felt comfortable. That, to me, is a sign of a good well fitting sneaker. Another great thing is that they were almost $10 cheaper than in the local store. I would definitely buy these again in the future.

I fell in love with how comfortable these shoes were back in 2014.  It's hard to justify switching to a different shoe when these are exactly what works for me. I use them for both normal day shoes and another pair for basketball shoes. They have held up really nice over the years. I'll normally switch out my every day shoes with my basketball shoes every 2 years and then buy a new pair to replace my basketball shoes. I highly recommend these shoes, especially to anyone looking mainly for comfort and arch support.

I use these for work when I don't need safety shoes on the floor. These are not safety shoes, but they are full-leather uppers, which my company requires at minimum. They are nice for a full shift on your feet. The soles are comfortable and supportive. My main caveat is to pay attention to width when you buy these. More of these shoes are available in the wide width, which will feel boaty on people who don't need the extra width.

Great shoe for walking. The 4E fits perfect for me and I've gone through several pairs over the years. The only thing stopping them from getting a 5th star from me is the squeaking! There's nothing like walking down an empty Hotel hallway to the sounds of your shoes squeaking! Seems loud enough to wake anyone sleeping on the rooms! But for the squeak you get ultimate comfort & fit. Which is why I keep coming back to this shoe.

I have found these to have excellent arch support.  One of the most comfortable shoes I have found.  As others have stated they squeaked awful and at work was quite embarrassing.  I resolved the squeak with baby powder.  Putting the powder inside did reduce the squeak but did not resolve it.  I held the shoes in my hand and flexed them to try and pinpoint the sound.  Seemed to be on the front top of the shoe.  I sprayed the baby powder all over the top and tried to work it into the vent holes and then flex it and tap the shoe to try and move it around.  I don't know why but I left them over night and then wiped them off in the morning.  Squeak gone.  I was very surprised as I was skeptical of the baby powder solution.  This lasted 2 to 3 months and I re-applied.  This has now been months and has not returned.  For me worth it since I find the shoes so comfortable. my 2 cents

The Nike Men's Air Monarch IV Running Shoes are great. They are very comfortable, and not ridiculously expensive like some other athletic shoes. I own 3 pairs of these shoes in various colors, and they all fit well.  They are also very comfortable. I looked all over before I could find the Nike Men's Air Monarch IV Running Shoe in the grey, white and fluorescent green colors in a size 13. It seems everyone else was out of that color combination, but not Amazon. I have high arches, and get sore feet because of it. While these shoes do have ""decent"" arch support, it is just not enough support for my feet. Either is any other shoe for that matter. I always replace the stock insole with the Spenco Total Support Max insole, and these become the ""perfect"" shoe. The extra expense for the Spenco Insoles is totally worth it for me. These shoes are also very durable, as mine have lasted a long time. Oh, and a little baby powder under the insoles will get rid of that annoying squeak that everyone seems to complain about. I would highly recommend these shoes.

I've had these shoes for over two years and they're still holding up with heavy use. There are no tears in the seams, and the soles are still intact. The only problem is they squeak like crazy. Seriously, people can hear me coming from hundreds of feet away. I'm not sure why they do this, but otherwise they're great.

I'm a big guy...240 pounds...and like to walk for exercise... It's been hit-n-miss for me as to finding a shoe with sufficient support for my weight. I last bought New Balance MX608 series and they were good and I would buy them again...However, I saw the Nike's were about $8.00 cheaper, and I thought I'd try them and save a few bucks...So far, the Nike's have given me good service...They fit as expected and appear to have enough support.  A running or ""cross training"" type shoe such as NB or Nike usually gives me 6 to 10 months good service - with daily wear - before breaking down...That's about what I expect...so I count on buying a couple of pairs a year...I would buy the Nike's again if the price is still right. Many Thanks & Take Care!

I've probably owned at least 9 or more pairs of this sneaker and this latest one is the worst of the bunch. Last pair ( 4 yrs old) was  comfortable, true to size, but as they aged, squeaked so loud I had to throw them out. Thought a new pair would solve this problem and did for about 5 months, but now are squeaking as well. Nike has obviously cheapened the shoe to increase their profit at the expense of the customer. The upper is now bonded to the sole using an inferior gluing process, creating the squeak. No longer mostly leather and now mostly plastic. No longer true to size and runs small and tight in the instep. Last pair for me.  Nike used to be an innovative company with a quality product, but now I guess they just save the ""quality"" for the higher priced lines.

I am a size 8 or at least I always have been. To be safe I ordered 8.5 and they seemed to fit fine until I actual played pickle ball in them. after the second time worn on the court my big toe was red and swollen and the nail was turning black. Amazon replaced the shoes with a size 9 and these fit fine. This is one issue with buying shoes on-line but I may very well have left a store with size 8.5 because they felt fine until I actual used the shoes on the pickle ball court.When it comes to issues with purchases Amazon is wonderful to work with. I will continue to buy everything i can from Amazon and I would purchase these shoes again.

Addidas are too narrow. Reebok are too short. New Balance curve into my big toe and don't fit at all. I keep coming back to these Nikes because they are the best fit I can find along with Rockport and Columbia.After 8 months, I'm reducing to 3 stars because this is the third pair of this model Nike where the sole has come unglued. I just noticed a flapping the other day and have put shoe goo on it hoping it will hold. The soles are blue and white and the blue parts always come unglued before they are a year old. I don't even wear the shoes every other day. I have others that I rotate with.

New Balance decided that they wanted to redesign their cross trainers. This made lots of people unhappy, including me. The toebox on the NB shoes was generous, but the fit was perfect. They decided to make it more narrow. And the wide sizes were too wide.That began my search for an acceptable replacement. I can't afford the new ""crossfit""/""crosstrainer"" shoes. I also don't think they provide the same stability.After trying lots of shoes, I settled on these. They are as good as my old NB 608 crosstrainers, but they'll do.

comfortable shoe and nice quality.  The right shoe began ""squeaking"" when I walked after two days.  Removed inside sole liner, put baby powder under it and put it back in place.  Squeak gone!  Did other shoe before the squeak started.  This squeaking sound comes from the liner rubbing against the base and is a common problem with these shoes. They are very comfortable and look like they may last a long time with limited wear. What do you expect for under $60?  I found that lacing them through the last hole that is normally empty and then pulling the opposite lace under that loop and then pulling down to tighten will make them more comfortable and put your weight on the ball of your foot. At the same time I bought these I also bought a similar pair by Adidas and they are just as comfortable and have no squeak.......yet.

I'd purchased my first pair of these Nike Monarchs about a year ago from Famous Footwear. I've worn them almost daily. They've been a good, all-purpose everyday shoe. After they're broke in, they're especially comfortable.I'd recently noticed that the outsole has started to ""peel away"" from the toe cap (upper portion.) The separating began in the toe area. I'm assuming the outsole is initially glued to the upper portion of the shoe and that adhesive must eventually deteriorate. (See images below)I've just purchased a new pair through Amazon.com for sixty-two dollars (if Amazon deletes that price from my review, suffice it to say it was very reasonable - in the same ballpark as what a paid at Famous Footwear.) When I ordered them, I used the exact specs on my old pair, e.g., size, style, etc. When I received the new Nike's, they seemed a tad tight (narrow.) However, they seem to be ""relaxing"" a bit the more I wear them.If these shoes had a little more durability (as in not coming apart), I'd probably give them a four-star rating. They're not quite the shoe that some of my Nike shoes of yesteryear were; but with the unmistakable Nike air cushion and arch support comfort, these aren't too bad.

I have ordered other brands of running shoes.  Most don't have the support or don't last long.  So, I went back to Nike for great looks, superior comfort and reasonable prices.  Brooks is another good shoe, but I have made mistakes in ordering, thinking I was ordering men shoes and found out they were women shoes.

My teen son has unusual feet. He wears a mens 15 4E shoe. As you can probably guess, finding shoes for him is so hard. I live in a small rural area which makes trying on shoes nearly impossible.  When we find a shoe that works for him we actually feel like celebrating! He has had these shoes in many different sizes over the years and they have always worked for him! He is a teen so the look of the shoe matters a lot..he loves these. He is not easy on shoes and they last him about 6 months of daily wear. The only problem we have is that the shoe laces are not very long for the size of the shoe. And finding long replacement laces is very difficult as well. Otherwise, I highly recommend these for those who have extra wide feet!

This is my normal “go to” shoe for work. I’m on my feet all day in the food industry. I have a lot of issues with my feet.

They were man made materials  and  generic.Back they go. Waiting for the Nikes!

I'm very active and play a lot of Pickleball.  These shoes wear well, even on outside courts. They have great traction and support inside as well as outside.  Good arch. Fit across the front of foot is less snug than most nice Nikes which is a plus.  I've found that other Nikes tend to be narrow across the front.  Because sneaker designs change so quickly, I bought extra pairs so when these do wear out, I've got exactly the same kind to use.  Highly recommend.

I don't actually run in these. I wear them for everyday use when I'm not at work. I have really wide feet. It's hard to find a decent pair of (non-ugly) athletic shoes in extra-wide. I've had 2 pair of the Air Alvord style over the years and loved them. One pair finally wore out (the newer of the two actually). The other pair has been relegated to lawn mowing use. This is appears to be the contemporary equivalent. I've been wearing Dan Post western boots and a pair of Converse Chuck II off duty. I wear Timberland Pro's for the other 40+ hours a week that I'm at work. Consequently, my feet are killing me. I broke down & got the $40 insole upgrade for the Timberlands (HUGE IMPROVEMENT!) and a pair of these. After three days I have way less pain over all. These are great shoes for people like myself who've been blessed with ""flintstone feet"".

Like the fit and quality as always with Nike.  Maybe it's just my feet, but I have to buy and use additional insoles or my feet will be in pain quickly. It would be nice if the shoes came with thicker and supportive insoles in my opinion. To be fair to Nike, I am a little heavier (weight wise) than average and I'm sure that too is at least part of the reason for the pain I experience when walking or standing for any length of time.

Yes, they are a decent pair of shoes. My biggest complaint is that for the price, the quality is a bit lacking. Long-term durability is yet to be seen, but they lack the feel of a well-made shoe that I have come to expect from Nike. Back in the day, you could still get a quality shoe from Nike without going into the triple-digit price range. These are not the least-expensive pair of Nikes that I could have bought, but they ""feel"" like they are.I am not referring to the fact that they are light weight, which is a plus, but more to the overall appearance and feel. The soles feel very ""plastic-y"", and make more noise than what I am used to, or care for. The rest of the shoe just feels synthetic and cheaply made. If this is what passes for a reasonably priced pair of Nikes today, then I am pretty disappointed. If it is just this model, then I feel a bit deceived.On the plus side, they are reasonably comfortable, and have a good bit of cushion at the bottom of the foot (insole?), hence the third star. The lessons I learned from this purchase are these: Don't always stick to one brand because you have known them to be reliable in the past, and perhaps more importantly, maybe shoes are just something you shouldn't buy online unless you have seen them and tried them on in person beforehand.

These shoes are a snug fit, decent quality, decent comfort, although it does not feel as ""bouncy"" as previous Nike Airs I've owned. I got the black color ones because they won't show dirt as easily as white shoes and can be used longer (hopefully a year at least!). I thought they wouldn't be that heavy and although they aren't as bad as boots, they are heftier than my previous tennis shoes. I was looking for decent running shoes to get some cardio done around the city and these are decent for that task. Overall they are nice, but if you are looking for the ""bouncy"" Nike airs I think those will be a little more expensive than these basic airs.

I've owned a pair of these before and loved them. That pair recently wore out. I wanted the same sneaker (Do they even call them sneakers any more?) and when I looked online, almost everyone was selling them for $10 more than Amazon. And while I usually try to support my local stores, having it delivered for free (amazon prime), with the promise of free returns, and for $10 less, I opted to make my first shoe purchase through Amazon because it was a brand and a style that I had already owned. They fit perfectly. The only difference is that the design of the show had change slightly, but with no change in the comfort or fit for me. So I was happily surprised and thus the 5 stars.

These shoes were an interesting buy quite some time ago. I’ve had them for about 3 years; but there is one thing I noticed a while into having them, the Squeaking. A few months into having the shoes they began squeaking and though I was a frequent walker back then, it didn’t bother me as much. I usually had headphones or other apparel covering my ears when I went out to walk. They were very comfortable for quite a lot of time; I did outgrow them nonetheless. I still have them to this day; and they are intact. I believed them to be good shoes; with minor issues.If you don’t mind the squeaking and want the comfort more than anything;Verdict: I recommend these.

After about a month of wearing these shoes (daily) they started to squeak badly, at work everyone knew when I was walking down the hall.Then 3 months into wearing them there is an area in one of the the shoes that is pressing into my ankle causing intense pain whenever I take a step.I basically have to throw these shoes away after 3 months.I've bought two pairs of these before without issue but I'm not sure I want to risk another $65.00 on these again.

These were a choice I made out of four brands, that were black and similar. I hadn't had a pair of Nike's in a while. So, I chose these. The arrival of the shipment got here ahead of schedule. The shoes I've learned to love. However, shame on amazon, for once again, I read false description. No leather uppers here. Like I said, I learned to love these Nike's. I was going to return them. However, not a conscious choice of mine. I learned that a synthetic upper for Nike, is in a class all by itself. These shoes work well for me. If there is any leather in the construction of this shoe, it certainly is not on the visible upper.

I cannot disparage this shoe. It simply wasn't enough better than my 4 year old New Balance to replace them. Also, and this is simply my own consideration, the front is so built up, the toe cap, that it won't fit easily into the rubber stirrups on the exercise machines at my club. I wasn't even wearing them at the time. I simply had taken one shoe out of the box and gone over to several machines. Sounds petty but I didn't want to struggle getting my feet into the stirrups on the machines. My old NB have a much lower front and they slip right in. Otherwise, a size 10 is slightly roomier than I needed, while still having plenty of room for a custom orthotic, which go into every shoe I purchase. So, that's a good point in favor of the shoe.

I bought these shoes not knowing they were the Air Dad's IV. Now, I understand why dad's swear by these shoes. Comfy and durable. I deliver packages for FedEx Ground.

They are a little bulky and wide but that's great for ppl like me that have ankles made of glass. (Less chance of sprains).

The shoes are replacements for another pair of shoes I had worn out. I have short wide feet so it is often difficult to get shoes. This was basically easy once I specified the make and model. Otherwise, searching for shoes is not so great, on any web site I have tried so far. The shoe fit well and was comfortable, the only complaint is that it wears funny. The outside sole of the shoe is wearing at an angle. I only wear the shoe for about an hour when I do my walk/run. I have a different pair of new balance sneakers I wear for everyday and they wear consistently on the sole of the shoe, nothing like these.

I just purchased them so I can't speak to longevity however, having worn many shoes in similar styles over the years, they feels like a sturdy shoe for a big guy with wide feet. Too many shoes are adopting the lightweight ""performance"" trend when most people aren't ""performance"" athletes. I hope these shoes will last a few good years of beating around workshop and garage with occasional pick up game of basketball or soccer with the family without coming apart at the seams (like the last 3 pairs of newbalance 600series).  They look and feel like good old-fashion leather training shoes. Time will tell.

I like the comfort, support works excellent.. Unfortunately I had the pull on the back of the shoe tear when I first put them on, but I like how the shoe fit so well that I didn't want to chance asking for a replacement. INstead, my wife sewed the pull back together for me.

Why are the major players in the athletic shoe market making these things smaller and tighter in the forefoot area and overall fit? Beats me! I am discusted by this trend. I have to keep trying to find bigger size shoes that will fit right every couple years. This is really getting tiring like think I am ready for retirement.

This is my third pair. It was the charm. I wear about a size nine or nine and a half shoe. I ordered a 9 it was too small, a nine and a half and it also was too small. The tens fit my foot very comfortably. I believe that they make this shoe smaller than the size it's supposed to be or manufacturing standards not the same. I thought a nine was a 9 but apparently it isn't. A 9 seems to be a 10. Having said that, these are a quality pair of athletic shoes. I'm positive that I will get a lot of good use from them. I would recommend anyone who is going to get them to buy maybe a half size of more larger than your normal shoe size in other brands.

This is only the second day of wearing these Nikes but I must say, they are really comfortable.  As always with Nike shoes, the quality and workmanship on these is top notch.  The 9.5 size is just a little bit small for me but not enough that I'd want to return them for a 10.  Unlike most tennis/running shoes these days, the arch support on these shoes is adequate - not great but adequate.  With so many other brands I try on, the inside soles are just as flat as Kansas (no offense Kansans).  The padding around the ankle and in the tongue is good.  The collar of these shoes doesn't come up so high as to rub your lateral malleolus.  I've returned several pairs for that problem.

Bought these for my husband.  He wears size 11 US.  These were tight when he first put them on and tried walking with them inside, but he figured they would stretch out.  After he committed to them, he found they didn't stretch out, and they simply caused him serious pain.  He's had to buy a completely different pair of shoes (Asics) after just a couple weeks.  Sad waste of money, this pair of Nikes.

I have been wearing Nike Air Monarchs for at least the last 15 years.  I recently bought a pair on Amazon for a trip I was taking.  When I arrived at my destination, I put on the shoes and went to tie the laces and the fabric lace loop pulled right out of the shoe.  I seems the fabric was not inserted correctly and the fabric was not sewn into place.  When I contacted Amazon, they had me send them back and I asked them to send me a replacement pair.  Last week I went to put on the replacement shoes and found that the pair that I had been sent had a manufacturing error.  The right shoe is supposed to have a raised area inside the shoe for the support of the arch of your foot.  My arch support is on the opposite side of the shoe making it impossible and painful to wear.  I am thoroughly disgusted with Nike for the lack of quality of their product, and with Amazon for the delivery twice of faulty products.  It seems that the 30 day return period is over because I didn’t check the replacement right away,  and that I am now out over $100.00.  Looks like both Amazon and Nike have lost my business.

My routine is, I wear my sneakers for a 2 mile walk every week day at work. During the summer months, I wear my sneakers full time.That being said, my previous pair of sneakers was a $30 pair of Filas. Given this routine they lasted just about 1 year.This time around, I figured I'd opt for a $60 pair of sneakers and see if they would, in turn, last twice as long.These sneakers fell about 5 months short of the mark. After 1 year and 7 months (which, to be honest, is still a pretty long life for a pair of sneakers) they were worn to the point where my socks would get wet walking in a puddle (or snow). In addition, they took a very long time to break in and feel right on my feet (especially my left). They also started looking really worn before they actually failed, but I don't care about looks.Not a bad shoe overall, but I didn't find them worth stepping up one tier in my shoe budget.

I bought a pair of Niki Air Monarchs in 2015 and have enjoyed the quality, light weight and style ever since.  I still wear my original ones but need to replace them with a newer pair.  The style, that has got me many compliments over the years ,is still the same, thank goodness.  You can’t go wrong with these shoes, they are a workhorse of a shoe.  The fit is so comfortable.  Thank you Niki for making a great product and still selling the same style from 2015.  The change I see is that the air insole cover the whole bottom of the shoe now, should make the shoe even more comfortable.

I find ""Nike's fit,""  the ""toe-box"" height and width, somewhat smaller than ""Reebok"" or shoes by ""LL Bean."" - I like a ""wider toe-box,"" I purchase the ""Air Monarch"" for the arch support. - Only ""LL Bean"" shoes have a similar arch support. I work standing on my feet so the difference in foot fatigue, less with an arch suport, is significant. - If you take a 12xw or even 13xw, a 14xw in the ""Nike Air Monarch"" would be none too big. - Good luck with the ""non-standardized sizing"" of the various shoe makers!

I ordered these shoes recently and they seem comfortable and well made.  The only downside of this purchase was the ordering process.  Once I placed a pair of men's size 8.5 Air Monarchs in my cart, the cart told me I had added WOMEN'S Air Monarchs to my cart.  I double checked to see that I had selected men's shoes, and I had.  I almost canceled the order but I figured it was just a typo and I would get the correct shoes.  Thankfully I did receive the men's pair that I ordered but Amazon still was telling me that I had ordered a WOMEN's pair throughout the delivery process.  Amazon needs to fix this.  It's really confusing.

When i first put them on, they felt good. But after a few hours for some reason they felt a little tight around the outer pinky toe area. They still kinda ache a little but i guess i can handle it for a bit and for the price. They seem like running shoes but theres no way i'm jogging in them if they make my feet ache a little with just having them on. Theyre ok though.

Me and these shoes have a love hate relationship... Ive been buying and wearing this exact shoe for probably close to 10 years. My problem with them is they start to squeek when walking usually about 4 months in. I deal with that for a month until it gets embarrassing then I replace them... With another of the same pair. They are just very comfortable and wide enough for my feet. I have 12 squeeky but cleanish pairs of these in my garage if you're interested...

I've been wearing these for a week or so.  Good shoe overall, with two glaring exceptions.  First off, an 11-1/2 is a little tight for a guy who normally wears an 11 very comfortably.  And I have never had a shoe with anywhere near as stiff and uncomfortable a tongue.  That thing scrapes against my leg so hard it is absolutely painful to walk in them.  I'm sure it will get better as they are broken in, but i have not worn such a painful new shoe in many years... This is an update: Nearly three months on, WOW ARE THEY PAINFUL!  This goes beyond just breaking in.  I walk the dogs in them for an hour and I wind up with my baby toe stuck to my sock with an open bleeding blister and my heel so painful I can't get my foot into a different shoe.  And I still have to tie the laces UNDER the tongues to keep them off off of my ankles . 😡😠😡

Slightly narrow around the front and middle section of my foot, but not so much I can't wear them. The first time I wore them they felt tight but the next time was less noticeable, and now they seem okay overall. Ironically, the heel area feels a tad loose, so that part of my foot moves up and down a lot when I walk. It's not like the shoe falls off or anything, though it sort of feels like I could ""walk out"" of them whenever I take a step (I never have). I like the look and comfort is fine now. Slightly better grip between the back of foot/heel and shoe would be better, but not a major issue.

I still have a pair of these shoes that I bought at an outlet mall almost 8 years ago and have almost worn them out. They have gotten pretty rugged looking but still comfortable so  I was excited to find this newer version of the same model on Amazon. They arrived quickly and fit perfectly. There was a stiff part to begin with on one foot where the stitching is near the little toe that cause some rubbing, but with some stretching and wear it softened up and is no longer a problem.

A bit wide for my feet, but the Nike Monarch is my favorite sneaker at the price point I bought it for. I have owned 3 pairs of these. When I first developed bone spurs in my heels, I was told by my health care provider that the only thing to do was to get good arch support shoes. I do add Dr. Scholl's Active Series foot supports to give me extra support (after removing the Nike insert that comes with the shoe. It worked miracles for my spurs and I must continue to do this to keep my feet from hurting again.

I purchased a pair of Nike Air Monarchs a few years ago. They were solid shoes, but did eventually wear out and I got rid of them. However, they were extremely comfortable. Since then I've tried a few other brands (adidas, saucony) but while they looked nicer, they never were as comfortable.Just bought this second pair of the Air Monarchs, and I can report that they are still as comfortable as ever. There is more padding around the ankle and under the foot than any other pair of shoes I've tried. They do add probably an inch to your height though, so don't be surprised if you feel a little taller.I have a wide foot, and this pair (US Mens 14W [4E]) accommodates it perfectly.10/10 would buy again, especially since they're not $120

This is the 6th year I've been wearing these. I've have the same shoes ever since graduating college. They're very comfortable and reliable, and have never failed me once.Typically these shoes last about 1 years. After that, the heels start to wear and the foam padding starts to come out. I walk in these about 60 minutes every day (including weekends) which tend to wear out my shoes faster than most people.

No issues. The fit was true for Nike. I have found that for me Nikes run about a full size smaller, so I usually order a 1/2 size larger, and hope for the best. they were comfortable right out of the box, and I'm glad I got them. I bought them during the winter time, but whenever summer rolled around they got very tight on my feet. Not sure why that is, I've never experienced it with any other shoe.

Love the fit, as I have used the white Nike Air Monarch's for years. But for some reason, there is an issue with the Black. Maybe I just do not see on the white shoe, but the Black seems to ""perpetrate"" a white residue thru the top of the shoe, which I assume is sweat.... I don't know what else it could be. Looks are ugly, to say the least. I have triedto touch it up several times with shoe polish, but it still returns every time I wear them! Which is a bummer, becausethey are comfortable, and I purchased 2 pair. I would recommend these if you don't care what they look like.....

I having been wearing these sneakers for years. I go through a pair about every year and a half. I always have a new pair in the closet to break out when the older pair starts to show excessive age. I then use the older pair for rough hiking trails and 2.5-mile daily walks and they hold up exceptionally well. Better than hiking shoes. They are the most comfortable sneakers I have ever owned and the price offers great value. They ARE NOT dad shoes, they are great for anyone at any age. They look good, feel good, great price and are made for high mileage use.

These are my favorite Nike for everyday working around the house and out walking. They wear well, are very comfortable right out of the box. I find I need no expensive insoles--the insoles that come with these fit my troubled feet like a glove. Comfort for me has been all-day worthy. Wear has been above average. Price is completely within reason for the quality and comfort. My size 12 foot will not fit most regular width size 12 sneakers due to the narrower construction that most makers seem to be using these days. So, I find that going with the 4E width gives me just enough breathing room for my foot to spread out without the shoe being too loose fitting.

Great shoes, needed all black, non-mesh shoes for work. Comfortable and non-slip. They did get a steak in the heel area when walking. My friend at work had the same thing happen, apparently it's common with these and is between the inside they use and the actual sole of the shoe...take a bunch of foot powder and put in there under the insole and on top of the insole and it stops that squeak. He found that online from other complaints. Worked for both of our shoes as well.

I've had around 4 or so pairs of these... I've always considered them to be the most comfortable shoes I could find... I also haven't looked very hard...

This is my 2nd pair of these shoes. Had the 1st pair for 6 months before the reknowned squeaking began. Unfortunately, I was unable to get the squeaking to stop even after applying baby powder to the insole as some previous reviewers had indicated helped them.Bought them again because the fit is perfect for my extra wide feet. That being said, I also purchased some Dr. Scholl's insoles which I am hoping will help alleviate any potential for future squeaking - or at least get me more than six months of usage this time around.

I got the expediated shipping and I tell you this thing comes fast. Ordered on Monday early morning (1 AM) and go to my front door on Wednesday afternoon. CRAZY as I live in Cali and it's coming in from Georgia. A great deal cheaper than zappos if you want it to ship that fast. As for comfort, these shoes have a flatter footbed so it's great for his swollen feet that no longer has much of an arch. And they are quite springy when i shoved my hands in there trying to get a feel for the footbed. Great buy and although pricey, not many brands have a 4E size so it's worth it if it makes my uncle work on his feet all day in comfort.

This is a good shoe.  I use these for general, everyday getting around.  They are my main shoes to wear to work, to go out socially and for hikes and pretty much everything else.  The laces loosen up nicely to let the tongue loosen way up around my high arches and the width is plenty sufficient for the wide area around the ball of my foot.  I recently bought one pair to test them out as they looked a bit different than the similar but not exact same Nike shoe I have been wearing for a few years.

It shouldn't be this hard to find something I like, but it has become that. I get mens' shoes because I have wide and flat feet. Most womens' shoes are very uncomfortable, they feel like a vice on my feet. And I'm not going to put up with that. I don't know what's wrong with designers & clothiers these days, but they are sure making crap. Those of us who can't afford a new wardrobe every season need to revolt.

They’re very comfortable, affordable, and they have that cool Nike swoosh that shows the kids that you’re still hip.The only issue is that they run a little wide, so if you order Nikes in extra wide (which I do, bc I don’t have the skinny foot of a hipster), you might want to consider a regular width.The Air Monarch: The official shoe of suburban guys in their late 30s.

The ultimate casual footwear for Dad or Granddad.Life is sweet when you're floating above the rest with stone cold chick magnets like these on your feet.Not advised for the youngsters.  It takes a certain level of maturity and experience to handle the  raw sexual attraction this footwear choice is sure to create on a Saturday nite at the VFW, local music hall or just strolling at the mall.Much like Hai Karate after shave, its a product best enjoyed by the mature and admired by the young.

Initially, they were great shoes and very comfortable to wear.  However, they have started squeaking as I walk in them.  Its kind if embarrassing when people look to see where the squeak is coming from.  They're still comfortable, but noisy.  I'm seriously thinking about spraying them with silicone to see if that changes anything.  The goofy thing is, its just the black ones.  I have another white pair and they don't make a sound.

EDIT (3 stars to 1 star with comments):In a nutshell, these shoes suck. I don't understand the good reviews on this clunky boat of a shoe. The more I wear them, the more I hate them. At least they stopped hurting my little toe. They have that going for them. If I wasn't so cheap I'd toss these shoes and buy something else. At least I'm getting more exercise as I walk as much as possible trying to wear them out ASAP. I just have to really watch we're I'm going because I'll be tripped up by something 12 inches away from where I though I was stepping.If you're looking for a shoe that's a size 9 on the inside and a size 14 on the outside, these are the shoes for you. If you want to be instantly transformed into a stumbling, clumsy person then you should buy these shoes. I guess the dad shoe look is in (I have no idea why, people are weird sometimes) and these shoes definitely have that dad shoe look. I guess if it's stylish to walk around like you're just learning how to do that, then this is your shoe.ORIGINAL REVIEW:The overall fit for the 9D is OK, not great. If I had tried these on in a store I would not have purchased them.The toe box is tight and not comfortable at all. If I go with a wider shoe I would have other problems. Just not a good fit for me. I'm keeping the shoe since I can live with the just OK fit but I would not buy this shoe again.

I am a nurse working in a hospital so I'm on my feet all day. I am tall and medium build and have wide feet. These shoes are comfortable, I just wish I could get them a little wider than the 4e. I wear a size thirteen and ordered the 4e, they cramp my pinky toe just a little bit but it's better than the other brands I have tried so far. If I could get them a bit wider I would give it 5 stars.

I have purchased this shoe 3 times only because it fits my foot really well while other shoes hurt. The major issue is the squeaking that starts to happen after you have worn them for a few months. All three pairs I have had has this issue and it is really disappointing, I really wish they would fix this.

If you don't mind everyone hearing you coming, these are a 5.  Annoyingly loud even after RIPPING out the glued in insole and adding some powder and dropping in a Dr Scholls.  They are comfortable and I use them to walk 3-6 miles a day with some running in there as well.  All day comfortable at the office on casual days as well.  Very recommended if stealth isn't an option or you are hard of hearing.

It's the first time I bought these on Amazon but it's the fourth pair of these that I bought. Work well for my feet.to be honest the only reason I bought them on Amazon is because I bought three pair before and I knew they would fit. If you've never purchased these shoes before I'm not sure I would buy them on Amazon as you won't be able to try them on first. The great shoes as long as they keep making them I'll probably keep buying them.

Perfect dad shoe they look alright there comfortable and once you find the perfect fit you know exactly what shoe and size to get when it's time to get a new pair no more wasting time trying on different shoes to find ones that work alright. it's my go to whenever I need a new pair because my time is far to valuable to waste going around to different shoe stores trying to find a new pair that I'll just end up dying green or getting covered in dirt. The fact that there finally on Amazon is just a huge plus.

I’ve been wearing Air Monarchs for 10 years. They’re handsome in black, and one of the few shoes which can accommodate a hinged foot brace I have to wear on one foot. They perform exceptionally well until they reach middle age, when they start to squeak. When it gets too loud, I buy another pair.

Very light and well built, good support and comfort. Great for various forms of exercise or a long day walking in protest of racial inequality or police brutality. I know Nike is a multi-billion corporation and their support of social issues is likely profit-driven, but when I need to buy clothes and I’m given the choice of a company that takes risks and shows public support for social change or a company that stays quiet, I’ll choose the one promoting a worthy cause every time. And these shoes are excellent anyway, and the price is right.

this is Nike's best and most comfortable everyday Non Sport shoe made by Nike.  even though it says  Cross Trainer it's a fantastic all around walking shoe.  this is the only shoe i've worn in over 20yrs when it first came out and the new Anthracite/Neon green color looks so cool and a nice addition to the lineup of colors.one advice is order one size larger because of the cushioning built into the shoe but the extra cushioning is what makes this a fantastic and comfortable shoe

I have worn a pair of these for possibly 20 years, and they are by far my favorite...  A buddy stopped by one day to visit, and at some point needed to slip on some shoes to walk out to the garage.  He slipped my old Air Monarch's on, took 2 steps and said, ""These are about the most comfortable shoes I think I've ever worn!""  Certainly ""broke in"" I believe..  That prompted me to purchase a new pair, and I am very pleased with them, Thank you!

For the price, can't beat it. Look good too. Fit exactly as expected them to. I'm 50 and they are comfortable enough, but it wouldn't what shoe I bought form anyone, I still got to use a scholls 50 dollar insert. But yea, these are def worth the money. I still like the comfort of the one's I've been wearing forever now, I just needed something different for a change. I order a size bigger nowadays as my right foot sort of swells up, or something(got diabetes now) and they fit good now with the scholls insert.

I have another pair of this style and size and wanted a backup.  Amazon Warehouse had a pair listed as ""Used - In New Condition"" so I bought them.  They were new.  Maybe had been tried on since the shoes were laced, but indeed like new.  Buying foreign made shoes is a crap shoot since they make them based on a metric conversion.  I wish wider sizes were readily available.  These fit well but could have been just a skosh wider.  I'm pleased with the purchase.

So I bought these shoes for work.  I read they were jogging shoes so I assumed they would be perfect for me.  When I received them I was surprised to feel how light they were.  They were much lighter than my other shoes I use for work and I was excited to try them the next day.  The next day I wore them for about eight hours and let me just say it was a very painful experience.  The front part is way to narrow for my feet, but not only are they narrow, but there are huge bumps inside where the stitching is located.  These “bumps” run across the shoe, starting from the area where my pinky finger is to the other side.  After a few hours my pinky finger was in pain and it hurt every time I took a step.  I first thought it was because they were new and I needed to mold them to my feet.  After 3 weeks of wearing them for over 8 hours a day I called it quits.  I was still in pain everyday with no end in sight.  I wore them with all kinds of different socks, I loosened my shoelaces and even bought this tool to stretch the inside out.  No luck.  These are probably the worse shoes I have ever worn in my life and I use to wear big ass steel toe boots.  If you are looking for comfortable work shoes do your feet a favor and look somewhere else.

I have another pair of these Nike's in the exact same size (12D) and they are much wider. Beware sizing is narrow! These pinch my small toe on each shoe, other than that they are comfortable. I didn't notice the pinching when I tried them on and walked around the house on carpet. This issue didn't come up until after I had worn them out shopping and had been walking in them on a hard surface. Otherwise I would have returned them. I'm hoping to stretch them out by wearing them a few times with thick socks, if not I'll be out $55.

I bought this shoes from Amazon after trying them on as a department store as that store sold out of my size when I went back the next day.

I have got a ton of compliments on the shoes and people like then.

I measured myself as a 8.5 4E and Nike comes through with this shoe. More than once in my life, I've had to buy shoes a size or two larger often in my life. I guess they weren't true 4Es.

These shoes are extremely comfortable to stand and walk in while working all day, which is what I believe they are really made to do.  So, job done.  However, they are very large bodied and well padded all around, making them warm to wear.  They look more like orthopedic shoes then streamlined sneakers.  I feel a bit like I'm wearing clogs.  So they are not as aesthetically pleasing as I wanted.

Very comfortable.  Won't likely need orthotic cushions, as the shoe seems to support the arch of the foot reasonably well.  Soft ride.Shoe is well built with strong material.  I don't see that it is likely to split out.I'm thinking that the fit may run on the small size, as my usual size of 9 is too small, thereby forcing me to order the 9.5 size.

Nice, light shoe.  A little more snug across the instep than I'd prefer but otherwise comfortable.  I ordered the 4W and they are still not overly generous in the width.  As others have commented, they do squeak on smooth floors.  For some reason this color was substantially less expensive than the others.  Don't know if I'd be as happy if I'd paid 60% more.

Bought as a replacement for an identical pair; after a full year of heavy use, the old pair started to come apart.It's about what I expect after getting chemicals, soapy water, etc. all over them daily, and hauling >1000lb pallets almost as often.

I have a wide feet and need shoes that come in wider size. Ideally, I use size 3E, but this comes only in 4E which is slightly bigger but much better than the normal width.

No issues with the quality of construction and it looks good.

Nice shoes. 4E size fits like a 4E should. A lot of people ask about the 4E. 2E is wide, 4E is extra wide. I found the 10 4E to be right on.These are marketed as running shoes, but they feel like very solid court shoes and I find them to be excellent in the gym. All leather uppers, so not quite as light as you may like for your running shoes. At the price point, they are excellent value. Made in China. No squeaking or marking or noise issues for me. Extra style tip, replace with red laces.

I have been buying new balence for the past 3 years, I decided to make the switch to these Nike monarch and I couldn't be more happy.First off I have wide flat feet, new balance seemed to be one of the only brands to give the wide option on almost all of their shoes. They are great, but these Nikes feel much better made, they are very light weight and the arch support is extremely good. For being a 6 foot tall 270 lb guy I go through shoes quite fast. I will update this review if anything goes wrong with these shoes. These are comfortable and awsome

I am not sure if Nike makes this poor quality product or if these are knock offs.  The laces broke fell apart on one shoe.  The shoe itself is weird.  The first part of the shoe is kind of narrow and tight, but the rest is more comfortable, but not as comfortable as other shoes we have purchased.  I got two pairs one for myself and one for myself.  We both can wear the shoes ok, but barely acceptable, we though they be wider.  I would buy again, only if we cannot find another brand with the same size.  The only positive was that they were not as expensive as other Nike sold locally.

I've never had to order extra wide before but I'm beginning to think that I may have to in the future.  Hopefully they'll stretch out some.

I've had two different pairs of Nike Air and this is my third.  There is a slight difference in the quality of the leather, perhaps because each pair was made in a different factory, from Indonesia, Vietnam, and China.

I normally do not buy Nike, however, after they hired Colin Kaepernick I decided to buy a pair to show my support for him and Nike. I now consider them my favorite pair of such shoes and I have other brands since I go to the gym 5 days a week. These provide excellent support for my 80 year old feet and legs and they are very obviously very well made. I will be buying more Nike as a result.

My son has worn this sneaker going on 10 years.  Was afraid they had changed or discontinued it.  They are still like  the ones he has on his feet.

When Nike made their shoes in Indonesia they were first class. Now every time I buy a pair of Nike sneakers the quality is marginally less than the pair before, they are a millimeter or two tighter and they are also getting to be like ""the jet that can't fly in the rain"" - Nike's sneakers used to grip well in the rain, now it feels like the grip is not that good and I have actually stopped walking in the rain. Also if it says 4E on the label then the shoes should be wide. My Nike 134E's are exactly the same length and size of a Nike 124E that I have from several years ago. Shame on you Nike - where is the American quality you used to be so good at. If you can't make then in America than at least make them in India or Indonesia. I am not the only one saying this, I have seen some pretty bad reviews about Nike over the last couple of years.

I purchased these shoes in 2019 but didn't wear them until middle of 2021.  After about 2 weeks of wearing, normal walking no running, the right shoe sole de-laminated and started this horrible squeak while walking.The shoe continued to be usable but is obnoxious to wear in public due to the loud squeaking sound while walking or changing load on the right foot.  I have abandoned these shoes and will use them only for work around the house

We just keep re-buying them because soon (we're guessing) they'll be discontinued and we'll be frustrated trying to find a new style that fits and feels comfy.

Here's the deal you either have to be a large footed dad to rock these or a legit MC.

Another reviewer said that the inner sole was glued in but could be removed for custom orthotics.  It appeared to me that removing the glued in inner sole would damage the shoe, and rather than do this, I opted to return them instead.  A rating of 3 stars is misleading; I shouldn't give the shoes a lower or higher rating because I couldn't use them.  The description said nothing about the inner sole being removable, so it was my fault that I had to return them.

My dad has worn these for years and years. After trying on his old beat up pair, I decided to get myself some. His latest pair are two years old, so they are beat up on the outside, but still as comfortable as my new ones. I thought the 10.5 4e might be a bit to wide for me, but they fit great. A little extra room is better than them being too tight(like most nikes). These might be my new everyday shoes. I'll update my review after I break them in a bit. Won't take long as I walk 5-10 miles a day.

i need wide shoes and this is super-comfy. Nike usually don't have wide shoes so am pleasantly surprised they offer this.

In the past I've bought less expensive sneakers at Sam's Club or WalMart but  they were not very comfortable nor did they last very long...This time I wanted something a lot better. I have two two bad knees that need replacing and wanted to ease the pain of walking.So although I've never had a pair of Nike Air Monarchs, I ordered them in hopes of getting a decent shoe that would make my walking easier.It was a good decision on my part. With basic standard shipping, the Nikes arrived quickly in just several days. The fit and comfort perfect. I gave these a five star rating for quality, looks, comfort. I'll do it again when I need them.

Fit surprisingly well considering I didn't order this size. I actually wear a 2E, which is a wide, which is what’s advertised.

Everyone's feet have their own special needs when is comes to shoes, so it's difficult to rate these for all.  For me, these shoes are the best walking/jogging shoes I have ever used.  I'm a geezer now, so I need training shoes that provide lots of support, and can absorb the pounding the foot gets from walking/jogging on asphalt. Like most shoes, it's probably best to find a local retail outlet and try them on, unless you have experience with them.

I love mine ,  the fit was right just what i had ordered .  I sometimes have trouble finding shoes to fit right.

As for the wide width or should i refer to the idea of people who need a wide width shoe,  the Nike Air Monarch IV (4E) are highly recomended in my book.

I own this show right now as a size 11 4E and it was really snug in the beginning.

When you buy Nike's, you generally know what you're getting into.  You're gonna pay a little too much for a shoe that's generally well-made and has nice comfort features.  These Monarchs here are no exception, aside from the fact that one of the shoes has an air bubble in the ball of the foot area or something that causes a loud squeaking noise when you walk.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to seem imposing to your Stormtroopers when every step you take makes it sound like you've got clown shoes on?  It's really maddening.Still, they're much more comfortable than my regular boots, so I continue to wear them.  I don't know that I'll buy this particular model again due to the design flaw, however.

The previous 4 years I've worn through 2 pairs of Brooks Addiction shoes. They're comfortable, provide good support, and can pass as 'business casual' while still wearing like sneakers.

i purchased these sneakers to wear at my job on casual days. after they arrived i tried them on and i immediately noticed that the right sneaker squeaked each time i took a step. i contemplated returning them. but i figured that the squeak would be muffled on the carpet in my office. i was wrong. the squeak is noticeably even while walking on carpet. i think these sneakers were previously returned by someone, and the company repackaged them and put them back on Amazon for sell.  i was the unfortunate one to buy and keep them.  that's my fault. but i warn anyone buying sneakers from this company to be wary.  they sell factory rejects and imperfect products and they count on someone buying them and not returning them after their defects.  being that i'll never buy from them again, it won't be me.

Best pair of tennis shoes I've ever had! Perfect fit, and very comfortable! This was actually the second pair I've bought. The older one I use for mowing, painting, and doing things in dirty places, and the other one for sports. Two of my friends have the same pair (different sizes) and are also very pleased with these. Totally recommend them!P.S. The first pair I bought about 2 years ago, and they're still in pretty good condition, just dirty.

I found this shoe several years ago. I have purchased several pairs over the years. I need the arch support provided. The only thing I don't like is they wear out after about a year or less. But I do wear then almost every day.

I have had the Nike Monarch shoes before and love them. However,  the last time I tried to buy some I was told that they were currently not available & I ended up taking some other Nikes that I really don't like at all. When I saw that the Nike Monarchs were available again I promptly bought a pair on line. I have a wide foot & the Nike Monarch 4E shoes are just what I need & enjoy wearing.

We buy at least four pairs of these a year. They fit well and look good so we keep buying them despite the fact that they flatten out pretty quickly (after about 3 months of wear) and they squeak when they start to wear about a month in.

After trying many other shoes, this is always the one we go back to for my husband. He has back problems and works on concrete all day and wears threw almost any shoe in about 6 months.

Great product, buy a new pair every 4 to 6 months. Great on your feet, and they come in Wide sizes. Only shoe i have worn since the new generation of NIKE shoes.

I love these shoes! I wear them for work. They offer great comfort and support. Unlike other Nike shoes, these are offered in size 4E, which makes them much more comfortable than Nike's multicolored fashion offerings. The only caveat....don't let them get soaked. They develop a maddening squishy squeak that seems to last forever.  Otherwise, great utilitarian shoes!

I have had two pairs of these previously, but I could not find them locally, so when I found them through Amazon, I snapped them up.  They are great shoes for foot support, which is why I got them.  And to the people who mentioned using the powder to stop the squeak in these shoes, I tried it on one of the old pairs, and that really worked well for me.  Took a day or so for them to fully stop squeaking, but they did.  If the new ones ever do that, I will be ready!

I spend 8 hours a day on my feet, covering about 6 miles on concrete. These shoes help me make it through the day without foot pain, in that respect they are great.

Really like the quality of this product!  They fit great, wear well and were very comfortable from the first time I put them on.

I know I have unique feet in general being a 8.5 4E shoe size. The shoes I got fit mostly, but the right foot seems to have a very common manufacturing flaw that has a slight inward curve to the outer side of the shoe that rises up too high. This causes a pressure point on the outer blade of the foot and not too noticeable for short distance walking. However any distance walking and for me at about a half mile this pressure starts to create a repetitive stress injury and by the end of the first mile my foot is throbbing in pain.I've experienced this same defect with New Balance's 409 series so this doesn't seem isolated to this shoe alone. But, manufacturers should be aware that an inward curvature to a shoe is something that can and has caused injury to people buying their shoes for the purpose of exercise. It needs to stop and function and health safety should always trump fashion.So I'm giving this shoe a 1 star rating because I can't use it for the desired purpose of walking for part of my daily exercise routine. They are effectively paperweights with the swoosh logo.

Once you turn 40, getting a pair of Air Monarchs is a rite of passage.  I've worn these to cook outs,  the Home Depot, and sometimes whilst doing yard work, basically things I previously would've never done, but now that I have my Air Monarchs I can do these activities with great ease.

I have had my Monarch IV's for about a year.  They fit well and are comfortable.  I ran into the same problems as others.  They squeaked right out of the box.  As described in other posts and videos, placing powder under the insole is a relatively easy fix.  So I though they were still worth the price.  After a few months of everyday wear (walking/standing) the sole started coming away form the upper at the toe.  Shoe glue has been required a few times with the problem getting progressively worse.  After going through this process, I found that these problems have been around for several generations of Monarch's.  Nike doesn't appear to be interested in quality control and is milking the brand.  We'll be looking for another brand in the future.

I've tried Nikes in the past and its always the same result.  I need a 3/4 EEEE size and they are hard to find in the Nike line.

The fit and the soles are perfect I like the options to be able to buy extra wide not all stores carry that. Nike runs small usually so I got the next size up and work great. They seek the same shoes at Big 5 and other shoe stores but you don’t have the color or the size options.

Keeping up with the Dad Shoe trend at a fairly low price. The shoe is so bulky that you’d think I wear a extra wide size but it actually fits pretty snug on your feet.

It's a really good shoe overall. I don't think they should advertise this as a running shoe though. It's a little to heavy for that.

If you don't mind he squeak it's worth it. Fair product.

I really wanted these shoes to work out. I had a pair a few years ago and had a squeaking problem. Was able to fix by taking out the insole and using 3 in 1 0il. So since it was a few years since I had a pair I would give them another chance thinking they must have fixed the problem by now.....NOPE. Tried the oil again and didn't work this time. Put so much in the shoe I would be afraid of getting near a open flame. The squeaking is VERY irritating so have to buy another (different) brand of shoe. Never will buy this brand again.
